Question ID: 10
Code Description: Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:

*   `'.'` Matches any single character.​​​​
*   `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "a "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**  "a " does not match the entire string  "aa ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "a\* "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** '\*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes  "aa ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "ab ", p =  ".\* "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**  ".\* " means  "zero or more (\*) of any character (.) ".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 20`
*   `1 <= p.length <= 20`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
*   `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.
*   It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.

Code Description: You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:

*   `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
*   `i + j < n`

Return _the minimum number of jumps to reach_ `nums[n - 1]`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,1,1,4\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

Question ID: 55
Code Description: You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` _if you can reach the last index, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,1,1,4\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,1,0,4\]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`
Generated Code:
    # Python Code
    class Solution:
        def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:

    # Problem Description3
    Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the number of **unique** k-diff pairs in the array_.

    A **k-diff** pair is an integer pair `(nums[i], nums[j])`, where the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is exactly `k`.

    **Example 1:**

    **Input:** nums = \[3,1,4,1,5\], k = 2
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).
    Although we have two 1s in the input, we should only return the number of unique pairs.

    **Example 2:**

    **Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4,5\], k = 1
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** There are four 1-diff pairs in the array, (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4) and (4, 5).

    **Example 3:**

    **Input:** nums = \[1,3,1,5,4\], k = 0
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** There is one 0-diff pair in the array, (1, 1).

Question ID: 87
Code Description: We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

1.  If the length of the string is 1, stop.
2.  If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
    *   Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`.
    *   **Randomly** decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.
    *   Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of **the same length**, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "great ", s2 =  "rgeat "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
 "great " -->  "gr/eat " // divide at random index.
 "gr/eat " -->  "gr/eat " // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
 "gr/eat " -->  "g/r / e/at " // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
 "g/r / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/at " // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
 "r/g / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide  "at " to  "a/t ".
 "r/g / e/ a/t " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is  "rgeat " which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "abcde ", s2 =  "caebd "
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  "a ", s2 =  "a "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `s1.length == s2.length`
*   `1 <= s1.length <= 30`
*   `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters.
Generated Code:
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  "a ", s2 =  "a "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `s1.length == s2.length`
*   `1 <= s1.length <= 30`
*   `s1` and `s2` consist of lower-case English letters.

# Problem Description3
Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of `s`.

A **palindrome** string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aab"
**Output:** [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "a"
**Output:** [["a"]]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 16`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

Question ID: 91
Code Description: A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' ->  "1 "
'B' ->  "2 "
...
'Z' ->  "26 "

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11106 "` can be mapped into:

*   `"AAJF "` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
*   `"KJF "` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`

Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06 "` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6 "` is different from `"06 "`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return _the **number** of ways to **decode** it_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "12 "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**  "12 " could be decoded as  "AB " (1 2) or  "L " (12).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "226 "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**  "226 " could be decoded as  "BZ " (2 26),  "VF " (22 6), or  "BBF " (2 2 6).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "06 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:**  "06 " cannot be mapped to  "F " because of the leading zero ( "6 " is different from  "06 ").

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

Question ID: 97
Code Description: Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s1` and `s2`.

An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s` and `t` are divided into `n` and `m` substrings respectively, such that:

*   `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
*   `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
*   `|n - m| <= 1`
*   The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

**Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbcbcac "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 =  "aa " +  "bc " +  "c ", and s2 into s2 =  "dbbc " +  "a ".
Interleaving the two splits, we get  "aa " +  "dbbc " +  "bc " +  "a " +  "c " =  "aadbbcbcac ".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbbaccc "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  " ", s2 =  " ", s3 =  " "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= s3.length <= 200`
*   `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.

Code Description: You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,1,5,3,6,4\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,6,4,3,1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Question ID: 122
Code Description: You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,1,5,3,6,4\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = \[1,2,3,4,5\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,6,4,3,1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

Code Description: You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = \[1,2,3,4,5\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,6,4,3,1\]

Question ID: 174
Code Description: The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in **the bottom-right corner** of a `dungeon`. The `dungeon` consists of `m x n` rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in **the top-left room** and must fight his way through `dungeon` to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to `0` or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only **rightward** or **downward** in each step.

Return _the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess_.

**Note** that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dungeon = \[\[-2,-3,3\],\[-5,-10,1\],\[10,30,-5\]\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** The initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path: RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** dungeon = \[\[0\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `m == dungeon.length`

Code Description: You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions: i.e. you may buy at most `k` times and sell at most `k` times.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 2, prices = \[2,4,1\]

    # Problem Description3
    Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the number of **unique** k-diff pairs in the array_.

    A **k-diff** pair is an integer pair `(nums[i], nums[j])`, where the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is exactly `k`.

    **Example 1:**

    **Input:** nums = [3,1,4,1,5], k = 2
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).

Code Description: We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:

1.  I pick a number between `1` and `n`.
2.  You guess a number.
3.  If you guess the right number, **you win the game**.
4.  If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is **higher or lower**, and you will continue guessing.
5.  Every time you guess a wrong number `x`, you will pay `x` dollars. If you run out of money, **you lose the game**.

Given a particular `n`, return _the minimum amount of money you need to **guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 10
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:** The winning strategy is as follows:
- The range is \[1,10\]. Guess 7.
    - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $7.
    - If my number is higher, the range is \[8,10\]. Guess 9.
        - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $9.
        - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
        - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
    - If my number is lower, the range is \[1,6\]. Guess 3.
        - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.
        - If my number is higher, the range is \[4,6\]. Guess 5.
            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.
            - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
            - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
        - If my number is lower, the range is \[1,2\]. Guess 1.
            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.
            - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.
The worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There is only one possible number, so you can guess 1 and not have to pay anything.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There are two possible numbers, 1 and 2.
- Guess 1.
    - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $1.
    - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $1.
The worst case is that you pay $1.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 200`

- If you guess 2, I will tell you that the number I picked is lower. Then you can guess 1 and not pay anything.
In both cases, your total is $1. So, $1 is the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 200`

Question ID: 376
Code Description: A **wiggle sequence** is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

*   For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a **wiggle sequence** because the differences `(6, -3, 5, -7, 3)` alternate between positive and negative.
*   In contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

A **subsequence** is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the length of the longest **wiggle subsequence** of_ `nums`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,7,4,9,2,5\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
One is \[1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8\] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\]
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

**Follow up:** Could you solve this in `O(n)` time?

    # Problem Description3
    Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array_.

    A **k-diff** pair is an integer pair `(nums[i], nums[j])`, where the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is `k`.

    **Example 1:**

    **Input:** nums = [3,1,4,1,5], k = 2
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).
    Although we have two 1s in the input, we should only return the number of unique pairs.

Question ID: 392
Code Description: Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `s` _is a **subsequence** of_ `t`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace "` is a subsequence of `"abcde "` while `"aec "` is not).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= t.length <= 104`
*   `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Suppose there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s1, s2, ..., sk` where `k >= 109`, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
Generated Code:
    # Python Code
    class Solution:
        def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
            i, j = 0, 0
            while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
                if s[i] == t[j]:
                    i += 1
                j += 1
            return i == len(s)

    # Follow up solution
    If there are lots of incoming s, we can use a binary search to find the position of each character in t. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(m*log(n)), where m is the length of s and n is the length of t.

    Here is the Python code:

    class Solution:
        def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
            index_map = collections.defaultdict(list)
            for i, c in enumerate(t):
                index_map[c].append(i)

            curr_index = -1
            for c in s:
                if c not in index_map:
                    return False
                indexes = index_map[c]
                bisect.insort(indexes, curr_index)
                curr_index = indexes[bisect.bisect_right(indexes, curr_index)] + 1
            return True

    This solution uses a binary search to find the next index in t that matches the current character in s. The binary search is performed on a list of indexes for each character in t. The list is sorted each time a new character is processed, and the binary search is performed on this sorted list.

    This solution is efficient for large inputs because it avoids the need to repeatedly scan through t for each character in s. Instead, it maintains a map of characters to their indexes in t, and uses this map to quickly find the next index that matches the current character in s.

    The time complexity of this solution is O(m*log(n)), where m is the length of s and n is the length of t. The space complexity is O(n), because we store a list of indexes for each character in t.

    This solution is a good choice when there are lots of incoming s and you

Question ID: 396
Code Description: You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

Assume `arrk` to be an array obtained by rotating `nums` by `k` positions clock-wise. We define the **rotation function** `F` on `nums` as follow:

*   `F(k) = 0 * arrk[0] + 1 * arrk[1] + ... + (n - 1) * arrk[n - 1].`

Return _the maximum value of_ `F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1)`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,3,2,6\]
**Output:** 26
**Explanation:**
F(0) = (0 \* 4) + (1 \* 3) + (2 \* 2) + (3 \* 6) = 0 + 3 + 4 + 18 = 25
F(1) = (0 \* 6) + (1 \* 4) + (2 \* 3) + (3 \* 2) = 0 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
F(2) = (0 \* 2) + (1 \* 6) + (2 \* 4) + (3 \* 3) = 0 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 23
F(3) = (0 \* 3) + (1 \* 2) + (2 \* 6) + (3 \* 4) = 0 + 2 + 12 + 12 = 26
So the maximum value of F(0), F(1), F(2), F(3) is F(3) = 26.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[100\]
**Output:** 0

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

Code Description: A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of `stones`' positions (in units) in sorted **ascending order**, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be `1` unit.

If the frog's last jump was `k` units, its next jump must be either `k - 1`, `k`, or `k + 1` units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stones = \[0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** stones = \[0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11\]

Code Description: An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of **at least three elements** and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

*   For example, `[1,3,5,7,9]`, `[7,7,7,7]`, and `[3,-1,-5,-9]` are arithmetic sequences.

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the number of arithmetic **subarrays** of_ `nums`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: \[1, 2, 3\], \[2, 3, 4\] and \[1,2,3,4\] itself.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1\]
**Output:** 0

Question ID: 458
Code Description: There are `buckets` buckets of liquid, where **exactly one** of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have `minutesToTest` minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.

You can feed the pigs according to these steps:

1.  Choose some live pigs to feed.
2.  For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs.
3.  Wait for `minutesToDie` minutes. You may **not** feed any other pigs during this time.
4.  After `minutesToDie` minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.
5.  Repeat this process until you run out of time.

Given `buckets`, `minutesToDie`, and `minutesToTest`, return _the **minimum** number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 15
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:
At time 0, feed the first pig buckets 1 and 2, and feed the second pig buckets 2 and 3.
At time 15, there are 4 possible outcomes:
- If only the first pig dies, then bucket 1 must be poisonous.
- If only the second pig dies, then bucket 3 must be poisonous.
- If both pigs die, then bucket 2 must be poisonous.
- If neither pig dies, then bucket 4 must be poisonous.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 30
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:
At time 0, feed the first pig bucket 1, and feed the second pig bucket 2.
At time 15, there are 2 possible outcomes:
- If either pig dies, then the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.
- If neither pig dies, then feed the first pig bucket 3, and feed the second pig bucket 4.
At time 30, one of the two pigs must die, and the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= buckets <= 1000`
*   `1 <= minutesToDie <= minutesToTest <= 100`
Generated Code:
 either 1 or 2.
- If neither pig dies, then the poisonous bucket must be 3.

Question ID: 464
Code Description: In the "100 game " two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from `1` to `10`. The player who first causes the running total to **reach or exceed** 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players **cannot** re-use integers?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given two integers `maxChoosableInteger` and `desiredTotal`, return `true` if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return `false`. Assume both players play **optimally**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 0
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 1

Return _the size of the largest subset of `strs` such that there are **at most**_ `m` `0`_'s and_ `n` `1`_'s in the subset_.

A set `x` is a **subset** of a set `y` if all elements of `x` are also elements of `y`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = \[ "10 ", "0001 ", "111001 ", "1 ", "0 "\], m = 5, n = 3
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is { "10 ",  "0001 ",  "1 ",  "0 "}, so the answer is 4.
Other valid but smaller subsets include { "0001 ",  "1 "} and { "10 ",  "1 ",  "0 "}.
{ "111001 "} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = \[ "10 ", "0 ", "1 "\], m = 1, n = 1
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The largest subset is { "0 ",  "1 "}, so the answer is 2.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= strs.length <= 600`

Question ID: 486
Code Description: You are given an integer array `nums`. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of `0`. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1]`) which reduces the size of the array by `1`. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return `true` if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return `true`. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,5,2\]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,5,233,7\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 107`

Code Description: You are playing a variation of the game Zuma.

In this variation of Zuma, there is a **single row** of colored balls on a board, where each ball can be colored red `'R'`, yellow `'Y'`, blue `'B'`, green `'G'`, or white `'W'`. You also have several colored balls in your hand.

Your goal is to **clear all** of the balls from the board. On each turn:

*   Pick **any** ball from your hand and insert it in between two balls in the row or on either end of the row.
*   If there is a group of **three or more consecutive balls** of the **same color**, remove the group of balls from the board.
    *   If this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left.
*   If there are no more balls on the board, then you win the game.
*   Repeat this process until you either win or do not have any more balls in your hand.

Given a string `board`, representing the row of balls on the board, and a string `hand`, representing the balls in your hand, return _the **minimum** number of balls you have to insert to clear all the balls from the board. If you cannot clear all the balls from the board using the balls in your hand, return_ `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board =  "WRRBBW ", hand =  "RB "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** It is impossible to clear all the balls. The best you can do is:
- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WRRRBBW. WRRRBBW -> WBBW.
- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WBBBW. WBBBW -> WW.
There are still balls remaining on the board, and you are out of balls to insert.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board =  "WWRRBBWW ", hand =  "WRBRW "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** To make the board empty:
- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WWRRRBBWW. WWRRRBBWW -> WWBBWW.
- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WWBBBWW. WWBBBWW -> WWWW -> empty.
2 balls from your hand were needed to clear the board.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** board =  "G ", hand =  "GGGGG "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** To make the board empty:
- Insert 'G' so the board becomes GG.
- Insert 'G' so the board becomes GGG. GGG -> empty.
2 balls from your hand were needed to clear the board.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= board.length <= 16`
*   `1 <= hand.length <= 5`
*   `board` and `hand` consist of the characters `'R'`, `'Y'`, `'B'`, `'G'`, and `'W'`.
*   The initial row of balls on the board will **not** have any groups of three or more consecutive balls of the same color.

Code Description: You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`.

You want to build an **expression** out of nums by adding one of the symbols `'+'` and `'-'` before each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.

*   For example, if `nums = [2, 1]`, you can add a `'+'` before `2` and a `'-'` before `1` and concatenate them to build the expression `"+2-1 "`.

Return the number of different **expressions** that you can build, which evaluates to `target`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,1,1,1\], target = 3
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
-1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1\], target = 1
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   `0 <= sum(nums[i]) <= 1000`
*   `-1000 <= target <= 1000`

Question ID: 514
Code Description: In the video game Fallout 4, the quest **"Road to Freedom "** requires players to reach a metal dial called the **"Freedom Trail Ring "** and use the dial to spell a specific keyword to open the door.

Given a string `ring` that represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string `key` that represents the keyword that needs to be spelled, return _the minimum number of steps to spell all the characters in the keyword_.

Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at the `"12:00 "` direction. You should spell all the characters in `key` one by one by rotating `ring` clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at the `"12:00 "` direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character `key[i]`:

1.  You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as **one step**. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of `ring`'s characters at the `"12:00 "` direction, where this character must equal `key[i]`.
2.  If the character `key[i]` has been aligned at the `"12:00 "` direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as **one step**. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ring =  "godding ", key =  "gd "
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:**
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. 
For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring  "godding " anticlockwise by two steps to make it become  "ddinggo ".
Also, we need 1 more step for spelling.
So the final output is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ring =  "godding ", key =  "godding "
**Output:** 13

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= ring.length, key.length <= 100`
*   `ring` and `key` consist of only lower case English letters.
*   It is guaranteed that `key` could always be spelled by rotating `ring`.
Generated Code:

Given an integer `n`, return _the **number** of possible attendance records of length_ `n` _that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it **modulo**_ `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** There are 8 records with length 2 that are eligible for an award:
 "PP ",  "AP ",  "PA ",  "LP ",  "PL ",  "AL ",  "LA ",  "LL "
Only  "AA " is not eligible because there are 2 absences (there need to be fewer than 2).

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** 3

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 10101

Question ID: 553
Code Description: You are given an integer array `nums`. The adjacent integers in `nums` will perform the float division.

*   For example, for `nums = [2,3,4]`, we will evaluate the expression `"2/3/4 "`.

However, you can add any number of parenthesis at any position to change the priority of operations. You want to add these parentheses such the value of the expression after the evaluation is maximum.

Return _the corresponding expression that has the maximum value in string format_.

**Note:** your expression should not contain redundant parenthesis.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1000,100,10,2\]
**Output:**  "1000/(100/10/2) "
**Explanation:** 1000/(100/10/2) = 1000/((100/10)/2) = 200
However, the bold parenthesis in  "1000/(**(**100/10**)**/2) " are redundant since they do not influence the operation priority.
So you should return  "1000/(100/10/2) ".
Other cases:
1000/(100/10)/2 = 50
1000/(100/(10/2)) = 50
1000/100/10/2 = 0.5
1000/100/(10/2) = 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,4\]
**Output:**  "2/(3/4) "
**Explanation:** (2/(3/4)) = 8/3 = 2.667
It can be shown that after trying all possibilities, we cannot get an expression with evaluation greater than 2.667

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 10`
*   `2 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   There is only one optimal division for the given input.

Question ID: 638
Code Description: In LeetCode Store, there are `n` items to sell. Each item has a price. However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more different kinds of items with a sale price.

You are given an integer array `price` where `price[i]` is the price of the `ith` item, and an integer array `needs` where `needs[i]` is the number of pieces of the `ith` item you want to buy.

You are also given an array `special` where `special[i]` is of size `n + 1` where `special[i][j]` is the number of pieces of the `jth` item in the `ith` offer and `special[i][n]` (i.e., the last integer in the array) is the price of the `ith` offer.

Return _the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers_. You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price. You could use any of the special offers as many times as you want.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** price = \[2,5\], special = \[\[3,0,5\],\[1,2,10\]\], needs = \[3,2\]

**Explanation:** There are two kinds of items, A and B. Their prices are $2 and $5 respectively. 
In special offer 1, you can pay $5 for 3A and 0B
In special offer 2, you can pay $10 for 1A and 2B. 
You need to buy 3A and 2B, so you may pay $10 for 1A and 2B (special offer #2), and $4 for 2A.

**Input:** price = \[2,3,4\], special = \[\[1,1,0,4\],\[2,2,1,9\]\], needs = \[1,2,1\]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The price of A is $2, and $3 for B, $4 for C. 
You may pay $4 for 1A and 1B, and $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C. 
You need to buy 1A ,2B and 1C, so you may pay $4 for 1A and 1B (special offer #1), and $3 for 1B, $4 for 1C.

Code Description: A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' ->  "1 "
'B' ->  "2 "
...
'Z' ->  "26 "

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11106 "` can be mapped into:

*   `"AAJF "` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
*   `"KJF "` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`

Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06 "` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6 "` is different from `"06 "`.

**In addition** to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the `'*'` character, which can represent any digit from `'1'` to `'9'` (`'0'` is excluded). For example, the encoded message `"1* "` may represent any of the encoded messages `"11 "`, `"12 "`, `"13 "`, `"14 "`, `"15 "`, `"16 "`, `"17 "`, `"18 "`, or `"19 "`. Decoding `"1* "` is equivalent to decoding **any** of the encoded messages it can represent.

Given a string `s` consisting of digits and `'*'` characters, return _the **number** of ways to **decode** it_.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "\* "
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages  "1 ",  "2 ",  "3 ",  "4 ",  "5 ",  "6 ",  "7 ",  "8 ", or  "9 ".
Each of these can be decoded to the strings  "A ",  "B ",  "C ",  "D ",  "E ",  "F ",  "G ",  "H ", and  "I " respectively.
Hence, there are a total of 9 ways to decode  "\* ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "1\* "
**Output:** 18
**Explanation:** The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages  "11 ",  "12 ",  "13 ",  "14 ",  "15 ",  "16 ",  "17 ",  "18 ", or  "19 ".
Each of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e.g.  "11 " can be decoded to  "AA " or  "K ").
Hence, there are a total of 9 \* 2 = 18 ways to decode  "1\* ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "2\* "
**Output:** 15
**Explanation:** The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages  "21 ",  "22 ",  "23 ",  "24 ",  "25 ",  "26 ",  "27 ",  "28 ", or  "29 ".
 "21 ",  "22 ",  "23 ",  "24 ",  "25 ", and  "26 " have 2 ways of being decoded, but  "27 ",  "28 ", and  "29 " only have 1 way.
Hence, there are a total of (6 \* 2) + (3 \* 1) = 12 + 3 = 15 ways to decode  "2\* ".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
*   `s[i]` is a digit or `'*'`.

 ways to decode it.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "1* "
**Output:** 18
**Explanation:** The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages  "11 ",  "12 ",  "13 ",  "14 ",  "15 ",  "16 ",  "17 ",  "18 ", or  "19 ".
Each of these can be decoded to the strings  "A ",  "B ",  "C ",  "D ",  "E ",  "F ",  "G ",  "H ", and  "I " respectively.
Hence, there are a total of 9 * 9 = 81 ways to decode it.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "2* "
**Output:** 15
**Explanation:** The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages  "21 ",  "22 ",  "23 ",  "24 ",  "25 ",  "26 ",  "27 ",  "28 ", or  "29 ".
Each of these can be decoded to the strings  "B ",  "C ",  "D ",  "E ",  "F ",  "G ",  "H ",  "I ", and  "J " respectively.
Hence, there are a total of 9 * 6 = 54 ways to decode it.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
*   `s[i]` is a digit or `'*'`.

Question ID: 688
Code Description: On an `n x n` chessboard, a knight starts at the cell `(row, column)` and attempts to make exactly `k` moves. The rows and columns are **0-indexed**, so the top-left cell is `(0, 0)`, and the bottom-right cell is `(n - 1, n - 1)`.

A chess knight has eight possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.

Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.

The knight continues moving until it has made exactly `k` moves or has moved off the chessboard.

Return _the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 2, row = 0, column = 0
**Output:** 0.06250
**Explanation:** There are two moves (to (1,2), (2,1)) that will keep the knight on the board.
From each of those positions, there are also two moves that will keep the knight on the board.
The total probability the knight stays on the board is 0.0625.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, k = 0, row = 0, column = 0
**Output:** 1.00000

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 25`
*   `0 <= k <= 100`

    # Problem Description3
    Given a string `s`, return _the number of distinct substrings_ of `s`.

    A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

    **Example 1:**

    **Input:** s = "abc"
    **Output:** 7
    **Explanation:** The seven distinct substrings are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "bc", "abc", and "" (the empty substring).

    **Example 2:**

    **Input:** s = "aaa"
    **Output:** 7
    **Explanation:** The seven distinct substrings are "a", "aa", "aaa", "a", "a", "a", and "" (the empty substring).

    **Constraints:**

    *   `1 <= s.length <= 500`
    *   `s` contains lowercase English letters.

Question ID: 689
Code Description: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, find three non-overlapping subarrays of length `k` with maximum sum and return them.

Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of each interval (**0-indexed**). If there are multiple answers, return the lexicographically smallest one.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,1,2,6,7,5,1\], k = 2
**Output:** \[0,3,5\]
**Explanation:** Subarrays \[1, 2\], \[2, 6\], \[7, 5\] correspond to the starting indices \[0, 3, 5\].
We could have also taken \[2, 1\], but an answer of \[1, 3, 5\] would be lexicographically larger.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1\], k = 2
**Output:** \[0,2,4\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`

Question ID: 691
Code Description: We are given `n` different types of `stickers`. Each sticker has a lowercase English word on it.

You would like to spell out the given string `target` by cutting individual letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them. You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite quantities of each sticker.

Return _the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out_ `target`. If the task is impossible, return `-1`.

**Note:** In all test cases, all words were chosen randomly from the `1000` most common US English words, and `target` was chosen as a concatenation of two random words.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stickers = \[ "with ", "example ", "science "\], target =  "thehat "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
We can use 2  "with " stickers, and 1  "example " sticker.
After cutting and rearrange the letters of those stickers, we can form the target  "thehat ".
Also, this is the minimum number of stickers necessary to form the target string.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** stickers = \[ "notice ", "possible "\], target =  "basicbasic "
**Output:** -1
Explanation:
We cannot form the target  "basicbasic " from cutting letters from the given stickers.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == stickers.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 50`
*   `1 <= stickers[i].length <= 10`

Code Description: Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return _the lowest **ASCII** sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "sea ", s2 =  "eat "
**Output:** 231
**Explanation:** Deleting  "s " from  "sea " adds the ASCII value of  "s " (115) to the sum.
Deleting  "t " from  "eat " adds 116 to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "delete ", s2 =  "leet "
**Output:** 403
**Explanation:** Deleting  "dee " from  "delete " to turn the string into  "let ",
adds 100\[d\] + 101\[e\] + 101\[e\] to the sum.
Deleting  "e " from  "leet " adds 101\[e\] to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal to  "let ", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.
If instead we turned both strings into  "lee " or  "eet ", we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.

Code Description: You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[1,3,2,8,4,9\], fee = 2

**Explanation:** The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices\[0\] = 1
- Selling at prices\[3\] = 8
- Buying at prices\[4\] = 4
- Selling at prices\[5\] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.

Code Description: Given a string s, return _the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in_ `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A subsequence of a string is obtained by deleting zero or more characters from the string.

A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.

Two sequences `a1, a2, ...` and `b1, b2, ...` are different if there is some `i` for which `ai != bi`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "bccb "
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The 6 different non-empty palindromic subsequences are 'b', 'c', 'bb', 'cc', 'bcb', 'bccb'.
Note that 'bcb' is counted only once, even though it occurs twice.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcddcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcba "

    Given a string s, return _the number of palindromic strings that can be obtained by deleting any number of characters_.

================================================================================
Question ID: 740
Code Description: You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

*   Pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. Afterwards, you must delete **every** element equal to `nums[i] - 1` and **every** element equal to `nums[i] + 1`.

Return _the **maximum number of points** you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,4,2\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = \[2\].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = \[\].
You earn a total of 6 points.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,2,3,3,3,4\]
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = \[3,3\].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = \[3\].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = \[\].
You earn a total of 9 points.

Question ID: 741
Code Description: You are given an `n x n` `grid` representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.

*   `0` means the cell is empty, so you can pass through,
*   `1` means the cell contains a cherry that you can pick up and pass through, or
*   `-1` means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.

Return _the maximum number of cherries you can collect by following the rules below_:

*   Starting at the position `(0, 0)` and reaching `(n - 1, n - 1)` by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value `0` or `1`).
*   After reaching `(n - 1, n - 1)`, returning to `(0, 0)` by moving left or up through valid path cells.
*   When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up, and the cell becomes an empty cell `0`.
*   If there is no valid path between `(0, 0)` and `(n - 1, n - 1)`, then no cherries can be collected.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[0,1,-1\],\[1,0,-1\],\[1,1,1\]\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right right to reach (2, 2).
4 cherries were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix becomes \[\[0,1,-1\],\[0,0,-1\],\[0,0,0\]\].
Then, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up one more cherry.
The total number of cherries picked up is 5, and this is the maximum possible.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,1,-1\],\[1,-1,1\],\[-1,1,1\]\]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `n == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= n <= 50`
*   `grid[i][j]` is `-1`, `0`, or `1`.

Code Description: You are given an integer `n`. You have an `n x n` binary grid `grid` with all values initially `1`'s except for some indices given in the array `mines`. The `ith` element of the array `mines` is defined as `mines[i] = [xi, yi]` where `grid[xi][yi] == 0`.

Return _the order of the largest **axis-aligned** plus sign of_ 1_'s contained in_ `grid`. If there is none, return `0`.

An **axis-aligned plus sign** of `1`'s of order `k` has some center `grid[r][c] == 1` along with four arms of length `k - 1` going up, down, left, and right, and made of `1`'s. Note that there could be `0`'s or `1`'s beyond the arms of the plus sign, only the relevant area of the plus sign is checked for `1`'s.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, mines = \[\[4,2\]\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** In the above grid, the largest plus sign can only be of order 2. One of them is shown.

**Example 2:**

Question ID: 792
Code Description: Given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`, return _the number of_ `words[i]` _that is a subsequence of_ `s`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

*   For example, `"ace "` is a subsequence of `"abcde "`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "abcde ", words = \[ "a ", "bb ", "acd ", "ace "\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s:  "a ",  "acd ",  "ace ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "dsahjpjauf ", words = \[ "ahjpjau ", "ja ", "ahbwzgqnuk ", "tnmlanowax "\]
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
*   `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`
*   `s` and `words[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.

    # Problem Description3
    Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the number of unique_ `k-diff` _pairs in the array_.

    A `k-diff` pair is an integer pair `(nums[i], nums[j])`, where the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is `k`.

    **Example 1:**

    **Input:** nums = [3,1,4,1,5], k = 2
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).
    Although we have two 1s in the input, we should only return the number of unique pairs.

    **Example 2:**

    **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** There are four 1-diff pairs in the array, (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4) and (4, 5).

Question ID: 799
Code Description: We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the **first** row has `1` glass, the **second** row has `2` glasses, and so on until the 100th row. Each glass holds one cup of champagne.

Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top. When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it. When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on. (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.)

For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full. After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full. After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now. After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.

Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the `jth` glass in the `ith` row is (both `i` and `j` are 0-indexed.)

**Example 1:**

**Input:** poured = 1, query\_row = 1, query\_glass = 1
**Output:** 0.00000
**Explanation:** We poured 1 cup of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There will be no excess liquid so all the glasses under the top glass will remain empty.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** poured = 2, query\_row = 1, query\_glass = 1
**Output:** 0.50000
**Explanation:** We poured 2 cups of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There is one cup of excess liquid. The glass indexed as (1, 0) and the glass indexed as (1, 1) will share the excess liquid equally, and each will get half cup of champange.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** poured = 100000009, query\_row = 33, query\_glass = 17
**Output:** 1.00000

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= poured <= 109`

Question ID: 801
Code Description: You are given two integer arrays of the same length `nums1` and `nums2`. In one operation, you are allowed to swap `nums1[i]` with `nums2[i]`.

*   For example, if `nums1 = [1,2,3,8]`, and `nums2 = [5,6,7,4]`, you can swap the element at `i = 3` to obtain `nums1 = [1,2,3,4]` and `nums2 = [5,6,7,8]`.

Return _the minimum number of needed operations to make_ `nums1` _and_ `nums2` _**strictly increasing**_. The test cases are generated so that the given input always makes it possible.

An array `arr` is **strictly increasing** if and only if `arr[0] < arr[1] < arr[2] < ... < arr[arr.length - 1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,3,5,4\], nums2 = \[1,2,3,7\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** 
Swap nums1\[3\] and nums2\[3\]. Then the sequences are:
nums1 = \[1, 3, 5, 7\] and nums2 = \[1, 2, 3, 4\]
which are both strictly increasing.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[0,3,5,8,9\], nums2 = \[2,1,4,6,9\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums1.length <= 105`

Question ID: 808
Code Description: There are two types of soup: **type A** and **type B**. Initially, we have `n` ml of each type of soup. There are four kinds of operations:

1.  Serve `100` ml of **soup A** and `0` ml of **soup B**,
2.  Serve `75` ml of **soup A** and `25` ml of **soup B**,
3.  Serve `50` ml of **soup A** and `50` ml of **soup B**, and
4.  Serve `25` ml of **soup A** and `75` ml of **soup B**.

When we serve some soup, we give it to someone, and we no longer have it. Each turn, we will choose from the four operations with an equal probability `0.25`. If the remaining volume of soup is not enough to complete the operation, we will serve as much as possible. We stop once we no longer have some quantity of both types of soup.

**Note** that we do not have an operation where all `100` ml's of **soup B** are used first.

Return _the probability that **soup A** will be empty first, plus half the probability that **A** and **B** become empty at the same time_. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 50
**Output:** 0.62500
**Explanation:** If we choose the first two operations, A will become empty first.
For the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time.
For the fourth operation, B will become empty first.
So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 \* (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.

Code Description: You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You can partition the array into **at most** `k` non-empty adjacent subarrays. The **score** of a partition is the sum of the averages of each subarray.

Note that the partition must use every integer in `nums`, and that the score is not necessarily an integer.

Return _the maximum **score** you can achieve of all the possible partitions_. Answers within `10-6` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[9,1,2,3,9\], k = 3
**Output:** 20.00000
**Explanation:** 
The best choice is to partition nums into \[9\], \[1, 2, 3\], \[9\]. The answer is 9 + (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 + 9 = 20.
We could have also partitioned nums into \[9, 1\], \[2\], \[3, 9\], for example.
That partition would lead to a score of 5 + 2 + 6 = 13, which is worse.

Question ID: 828
Code Description: Let's define a function `countUniqueChars(s)` that returns the number of unique characters on `s`.

*   For example, calling `countUniqueChars(s)` if `s = "LEETCODE "` then `"L "`, `"T "`, `"C "`, `"O "`, `"D "` are the unique characters since they appear only once in `s`, therefore `countUniqueChars(s) = 5`.

Given a string `s`, return the sum of `countUniqueChars(t)` where `t` is a substring of `s`. The test cases are generated such that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

Notice that some substrings can be repeated so in this case you have to count the repeated ones too.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "ABC "
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** All possible substrings are:  "A ", "B ", "C ", "AB ", "BC " and  "ABC ".
Every substring is composed with only unique letters.
Sum of lengths of all substring is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "ABA "
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** The same as example 1, except `countUniqueChars`( "ABA ") = 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "LEETCODE "
**Output:** 92

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
*   `s` consists of uppercase English letters only.

Question ID: 834
Code Description: There is an undirected connected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` edges.

You are given the integer `n` and the array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

Return an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the sum of the distances between the `ith` node in the tree and all other nodes.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 6, edges = \[\[0,1\],\[0,2\],\[2,3\],\[2,4\],\[2,5\]\]
**Output:** \[8,12,6,10,10,10\]
**Explanation:** The tree is shown above.
We can see that dist(0,1) + dist(0,2) + dist(0,3) + dist(0,4) + dist(0,5)
equals 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.
Hence, answer\[0\] = 8, and so on.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, edges = \[\]
**Output:** \[0\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 2, edges = \[\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[1,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 3 * 104`
*   `edges.length == n - 1`
*   `edges[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= ai, bi < n`

Question ID: 837
Code Description: Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game **"21 "**.

Alice starts with `0` points and draws numbers while she has less than `k` points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range `[1, maxPts]`, where `maxPts` is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `k` **or more points**.

Return the probability that Alice has `n` or fewer points.

Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer are considered accepted.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10

Question ID: 838
Code Description: There are `n` dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright. In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.

After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.

When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.

For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.

You are given a string `dominoes` representing the initial state where:

*   `dominoes[i] = 'L'`, if the `ith` domino has been pushed to the left,
*   `dominoes[i] = 'R'`, if the `ith` domino has been pushed to the right, and
*   `dominoes[i] = '.'`, if the `ith` domino has not been pushed.

Return _a string representing the final state_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dominoes =  "RR.L "
**Output:**  "RR.L "
**Explanation:** The first domino expends no additional force on the second domino.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** dominoes =  ".L.R...LR..L.. "
**Output:**  "LL.RR.LLRRLL.. "

**Constraints:**

*   `n == dominoes.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `dominoes[i]` is either `'L'`, `'R'`, or `'.'`.

Question ID: 871
Code Description: A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is `target` miles east of the starting position.

There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array `stations` where `stations[i] = [positioni, fueli]` indicates that the `ith` gas station is `positioni` miles east of the starting position and has `fueli` liters of gas.

The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has `startFuel` liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.

Return _the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination_. If it cannot reach the destination, return `-1`.

Note that if the car reaches a gas station with `0` fuel left, the car can still refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with `0` fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = \[\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** We can reach the target without refueling.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = \[\[10,100\]\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** We can not reach the target (or even the first gas station).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = \[\[10,60\],\[20,30\],\[30,30\],\[60,40\]\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We start with 10 liters of fuel.
We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0 liters to 60 liters of gas.
Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),
and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas.  We then drive to and reach the target.
We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= target, startFuel <= 109`
*   `0 <= stations.length <= 500`
*   `1 <= positioni < positioni+1 < target`
*   `1 <= fueli < 109`
Generated Code:

# Problem Description3
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array_.

A k-diff pair is an integer pair `(nums[i], nums[j])`, where the following are true:

*   `0 <= i, j < nums.length`
*   `i != j`
*   `|nums[i] - nums[j]| == k`

Notice that `|val|` denotes the absolute value of `val`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,1,4,1,5], k = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).
Although we have two 1s in the input, we should only return the number of unique pairs.

Question ID: 877
Code Description: Alice and Bob play a game with piles of stones. There are an **even** number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a **positive** integer number of stones `piles[i]`.

The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. The **total** number of stones across all the piles is **odd**, so there are no ties.

Alice and Bob take turns, with **Alice starting first**. Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones either from the **beginning** or from the **end** of the row. This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the **most stones wins**.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return `true` _if Alice wins the game, or_ `false` _if Bob wins_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** piles = \[5,3,4,5\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
Alice starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.
Say she takes the first 5, so that the row becomes \[3, 4, 5\].
If Bob takes 3, then the board is \[4, 5\], and Alice takes 5 to win with 10 points.
If Bob takes the last 5, then the board is \[3, 4\], and Alice takes 4 to win with 9 points.
This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alice, so we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** piles = \[3,7,2,3\]
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= piles.length <= 500`
*   `piles.length` is **even**.
*   `1 <= piles[i] <= 500`
*   `sum(piles[i])` is **odd**.

Question ID: 879
Code Description: There is a group of `n` members, and a list of various crimes they could commit. The `ith` crime generates a `profit[i]` and requires `group[i]` members to participate in it. If a member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.

Let's call a **profitable scheme** any subset of these crimes that generates at least `minProfit` profit, and the total number of members participating in that subset of crimes is at most `n`.

Return the number of schemes that can be chosen. Since the answer may be very large, **return it modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, minProfit = 3, group = \[2,2\], profit = \[2,3\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** To make a profit of at least 3, the group could either commit crimes 0 and 1, or just crime 1.
In total, there are 2 schemes.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 10, minProfit = 5, group = \[2,3,5\], profit = \[6,7,8\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** To make a profit of at least 5, the group could commit any crimes, as long as they commit one.
There are 7 possible schemes: (0), (1), (2), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), and (0,1,2).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 100`
*   `0 <= minProfit <= 100`
*   `1 <= group.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= group[i] <= 100`

Question ID: 887
Code Description: You are given `k` identical eggs and you have access to a building with `n` floors labeled from `1` to `n`.

You know that there exists a floor `f` where `0 <= f <= n` such that any egg dropped at a floor **higher** than `f` will **break**, and any egg dropped **at or below** floor `f` will **not break**.

Each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor `x` (where `1 <= x <= n`). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may **reuse** it in future moves.

Return _the **minimum number of moves** that you need to determine **with certainty** what the value of_ `f` is.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 1, n = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 
Drop the egg from floor 1. If it breaks, we know that f = 0.
Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2. If it breaks, we know that f = 1.
If it does not break, then we know f = 2.
Hence, we need at minimum 2 moves to determine with certainty what the value of f is.

**Input:** k = 2, n = 6
**Output:** 3

Question ID: 913
Code Description: A game on an **undirected** graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[a]` is a list of all nodes `b` such that `ab` is an edge of the graph.

The mouse starts at node `1` and goes first, the cat starts at node `2` and goes second, and there is a hole at node `0`.

During each player's turn, they **must** travel along one edge of the graph that meets where they are. For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it **must** travel to any node in `graph[1]`.

Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0.)

Then, the game can end in three ways:

*   If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.
*   If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.
*   If ever a position is repeated (i.e., the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw.

Given a `graph`, and assuming both players play optimally, return

*   `1` if the mouse wins the game,
*   `2` if the cat wins the game, or
*   `0` if the game is a draw.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[2,5\],\[3\],\[0,4,5\],\[1,4,5\],\[2,3\],\[0,2,3\]\]
**Output:** 0

**Example 2:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,3\],\[0\],\[3\],\[0,2\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `3 <= graph.length <= 50`
*   `1 <= graph[i].length < graph.length`
*   `0 <= graph[i][j] < graph.length`
*   `graph[i][j] != i`
*   `graph[i]` is unique.
*   The mouse and the cat can always move.

Code Description: Given a **circular integer array** `nums` of length `n`, return _the maximum possible sum of a non-empty **subarray** of_ `nums`.

A **circular array** means the end of the array connects to the beginning of the array. Formally, the next element of `nums[i]` is `nums[(i + 1) % n]` and the previous element of `nums[i]` is `nums[(i - 1 + n) % n]`.

A **subarray** may only include each element of the fixed buffer `nums` at most once. Formally, for a subarray `nums[i], nums[i + 1], ..., nums[j]`, there does not exist `i <= k1`, `k2 <= j` with `k1 % n == k2 % n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,-2,3,-2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Subarray \[3\] has maximum sum 3.

**Example 2:**

    # Problem Description3
    Given an array of integers `nums`, calculate the _pivot_ index of this array.

The _pivot_ index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.

If the _pivot_ index is not found, return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,7,3,6,5,6\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
The pivot index is 3.
Left sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11
Right sum = nums[4] + nums[5] = 5 + 6 = 11

A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

We have a chess knight and a phone pad as shown below, the knight **can only stand on a numeric cell** (i.e. blue cell).

Given an integer `n`, return how many distinct phone numbers of length `n` we can dial.

You are allowed to place the knight **on any numeric cell** initially and then you should perform `n - 1` jumps to dial a number of length `n`. All jumps should be **valid** knight jumps.

As the answer may be very large, **return the answer modulo** `109 + 7`.

Code Description: Given a string s, return _the number of **distinct non-empty subsequences** of_ `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace "` is a subsequence of `"abcde "` while `"aec "` is not.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "abc "
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** The 7 distinct subsequences are  "a ",  "b ",  "c ",  "ab ",  "ac ",  "bc ", and  "abc ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "aba "
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The 6 distinct subsequences are  "a ",  "b ",  "ab ",  "aa ",  "ba ", and  "aba ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "aaa "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The 3 distinct subsequences are  "a ",  "aa " and  "aaa ".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

    # Problem Description3
    Given a string s, return _the number of **distinct subsequences** of_ `s` _that are palindromic._ Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace "` is a subsequence of `"abcde "` while `"aec "` is not.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "bccb "
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The 6 distinct palindromic subsequences are  "b ",  "c ",  "cc ",  "bcb ",  "bccb " and  "bccc ". (The ones that are not palindromic are "bba ", "bbbb ", and "bbaa ".)

Code Description: You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height. The billboard will have two steel supports, one on each side. Each steel support must be an equal height.

You are given a collection of `rods` that can be welded together. For example, if you have rods of lengths `1`, `2`, and `3`, you can weld them together to make a support of length `6`.

Return _the largest possible height of your billboard installation_. If you cannot support the billboard, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** rods = \[1,2,3,6\]

Question ID: 960
Code Description: You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length.

We may choose any deletion indices, and we delete all the characters in those indices for each string.

For example, if we have `strs = [ "abcdef ", "uvwxyz "]` and deletion indices `{0, 2, 3}`, then the final array after deletions is `[ "bef ", "vyz "]`.

Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices `answer` such that after deletions, the final array has **every string (row) in lexicographic** order. (i.e., `(strs[0][0] <= strs[0][1] <= ... <= strs[0][strs[0].length - 1])`, and `(strs[1][0] <= strs[1][1] <= ... <= strs[1][strs[1].length - 1])`, and so on). Return _the minimum possible value of_ `answer.length`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = \[ "babca ", "bbazb "\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After deleting columns 0, 1, and 4, the final array is strs = \[ "bc ",  "az "\].
Both these rows are individually in lexicographic order (ie. strs\[0\]\[0\] <= strs\[0\]\[1\] and strs\[1\]\[0\] <= strs\[1\]\[1\]).
Note that strs\[0\] > strs\[1\] - the array strs is not necessarily in lexicographic order.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = \[ "edcba "\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** If we delete less than 4 columns, the only row will not be lexicographically sorted.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** strs = \[ "ghi ", "def ", "abc "\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** All rows are already lexicographically sorted.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == strs.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 100`
*   `1 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
*   `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

Question ID: 964
Code Description: Given a single positive integer `x`, we will write an expression of the form `x (op1) x (op2) x (op3) x ...` where each operator `op1`, `op2`, etc. is either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/)`. For example, with `x = 3`, we might write `3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3` which is a value of 3.

When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:

*   The division operator (`/`) returns rational numbers.
*   There are no parentheses placed anywhere.
*   We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.
*   It is not allowed to use the unary negation operator (`-`). For example, "`x - x` " is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but "`-x + x` " is not because it uses negation.

We would like to write an expression with the least number of operators such that the expression equals the given `target`. Return the least number of operators used.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 3, target = 19
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** 3 \* 3 + 3 \* 3 + 3 / 3.
The expression contains 5 operations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = 5, target = 501
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** 5 \* 5 \* 5 \* 5 - 5 \* 5 \* 5 + 5 / 5.
The expression contains 8 operations.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** x = 100, target = 100000000
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 100 \* 100 \* 100 \* 100.

Question ID: 975
Code Description: You are given an integer array `arr`. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called **odd-numbered jumps**, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called **even-numbered jumps**. Note that the **jumps** are numbered, not the indices.

You may jump forward from index `i` to index `j` (with `i < j`) in the following way:

*   During **odd-numbered jumps** (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] <= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the **smallest** such index `j`.
*   During **even-numbered jumps** (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] >= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the **smallest** such index `j`.
*   It may be the case that for some index `i`, there are no legal jumps.

A starting index is **good** if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index `arr.length - 1`) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).

Return _the number of **good** starting indices_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[10,13,12,14,15\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 
From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr\[2\] is the smallest among arr\[1\], arr\[2\], arr\[3\], arr\[4\] that is greater or equal to arr\[0\]), then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.
From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.
In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of
jumps.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = \[2,3,1,1,4\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 
From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:
During our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr\[1\] is the smallest value in \[arr\[1\], arr\[2\], arr\[3\], arr\[4\]\] that is greater than or equal to arr\[0\].
During our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr\[2\] is the largest value in \[arr\[2\], arr\[3\], arr\[4\]\] that is less than or equal to arr\[1\]. arr\[3\] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3
During our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr\[3\] is the smallest value in \[arr\[3\], arr\[4\]\] that is greater than or equal to arr\[2\].
We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.
In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.
From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.
In total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some
number of jumps.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = \[5,1,3,4,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can reach the end from starting indices 1, 2, and 4.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= arr.length <= 2 * 104`
*   `0 <= arr[i] < 105`
Generated Code:
 this is a good starting index.

**Input:** arr = \[2,3,1,1,4\]

**Explanation:** 
From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 1, then 2nd jump to i = 2, then 3rd jump to i = 3, so this is a good starting index.
From starting index i = 1, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so this is also a good starting index.
From starting index i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then 2nd jump to i = 4, so this is also a good starting index.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = \[5,1,3,4,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 
From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 1, then 2nd jump to i = 4, so this is a good starting index.
From starting index i = 1, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2, then 2nd jump to i = 3, then 3rd jump to i = 4, so this is also a good starting index.
From starting index i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so this is also a good starting index.

Code Description: Given an integer array `arr`, return _the length of a maximum size turbulent subarray of_ `arr`.

A subarray is **turbulent** if the comparison sign flips between each adjacent pair of elements in the subarray.

More formally, a subarray `[arr[i], arr[i + 1], ..., arr[j]]` of `arr` is said to be turbulent if and only if:

*   For `i <= k < j`:
    *   `arr[k] > arr[k + 1]` when `k` is odd, and
    *   `arr[k] < arr[k + 1]` when `k` is even.
*   Or, for `i <= k < j`:
    *   `arr[k] > arr[k + 1]` when `k` is even, and
    *   `arr[k] < arr[k + 1]` when `k` is odd.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[9,4,2,10,7,8,8,1,9\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** arr\[1\] > arr\[2\] < arr\[3\] > arr\[4\] < arr\[5\]

Question ID: 983
Code Description: You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array `days`. Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.

Train tickets are sold in **three different ways**:

*   a **1-day** pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars,
*   a **7-day** pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars, and
*   a **30-day** pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

*   For example, if we get a **7-day** pass on day `2`, then we can travel for `7` days: `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, and `8`.

Return _the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** days = \[1,4,6,7,8,20\], costs = \[2,7,15\]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs\[0\] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs\[1\] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs\[0\] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total, you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** days = \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31\], costs = \[2,7,15\]
**Output:** 17
**Explanation:** For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs\[2\] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs\[0\] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total, you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= days.length <= 365`
*   `1 <= days[i] <= 365`
*   `days` is in strictly increasing order.
*   `costs.length == 3`
*   `1 <= costs[i] <= 1000`
Generated Code:

In total, you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

**Constraints:**

*   `days` is an array of distinct integers.
*   `costs` is an array of length 3 with positive integers.
*   `days[i]` is in the range `[1, 365]`.

Code Description: There are `n` piles of `stones` arranged in a row. The `ith` pile has `stones[i]` stones.

A move consists of merging exactly `k` **consecutive** piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these `k` piles.

Return _the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile_. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stones = \[3,2,4,1\], k = 2
**Output:** 20
**Explanation:** We start with \[3, 2, 4, 1\].
We merge \[3, 2\] for a cost of 5, and we are left with \[5, 4, 1\].
We merge \[4, 1\] for a cost of 5, and we are left with \[5, 5\].
We merge \[5, 5\] for a cost of 10, and we are left with \[10\].
The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** stones = \[3,2,4,1\], k = 3
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.

Code Description: You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted `time` seconds. These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varying lengths.

Each video clip is described by an array `clips` where `clips[i] = [starti, endi]` indicates that the ith clip started at `starti` and ended at `endi`.

We can cut these clips into segments freely.

*   For example, a clip `[0, 7]` can be cut into segments `[0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7]`.

Return _the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event_ `[0, time]`. If the task is impossible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** clips = \[\[0,2\],\[4,6\],\[8,10\],\[1,9\],\[1,5\],\[5,9\]\], time = 10
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We take the clips \[0,2\], \[8,10\], \[1,9\]; a total of 3 clips.
Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
We cut \[1,9\] into segments \[1,2\] + \[2,8\] + \[8,9\].
Now we have segments \[0,2\] + \[2,8\] + \[8,10\] which cover the sporting event \[0, 10\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** clips = \[\[0,1\],\[1,2\]\], time = 5
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** We cannot cover \[0,5\] with only \[0,1\] and \[1,2\].

**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can take clips \[0,4\], \[4,7\], and \[6,9\].

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= clips.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= starti <= endi <= 100`

Code Description: Given an array `nums` of integers, return _the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in_ `nums`.

**Note** that:

*   A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
*   A sequence `seq` is arithmetic if `seq[i + 1] - seq[i]` are all the same value (for `0 <= i < seq.length - 1`).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,6,9,12\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation: ** The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[9,4,7,2,10\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation: ** The longest arithmetic subsequence is \[4,7,10\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[20,1,15,3,10,5,8\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation: ** The longest arithmetic subsequence is \[20,15,10,5\].

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 500`

Code Description: You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. We write the integers of `nums1` and `nums2` (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.

We may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]` such that:

*   `nums1[i] == nums2[j]`, and
*   the line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.

Note that a connecting line cannot intersect even at the endpoints (i.e., each number can only belong to one connecting line).

Return _the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,4,2\], nums2 = \[1,2,4\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.
We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from nums1\[1\] = 4 to nums2\[2\] = 4 will intersect the line from nums1\[2\]=2 to nums2\[1\]=2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[2,5,1,2,5\], nums2 = \[10,5,2,1,5,2\]

Code Description: You have a convex `n`\-sided polygon where each vertex has an integer value. You are given an integer array `values` where `values[i]` is the value of the `ith` vertex (i.e., **clockwise order**).

You will **triangulate** the polygon into `n - 2` triangles. For each triangle, the value of that triangle is the product of the values of its vertices, and the total score of the triangulation is the sum of these values over all `n - 2` triangles in the triangulation.

Return _the smallest possible total score that you can achieve with some triangulation of the polygon_.

Code Description: You are given an array of `words` where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

`wordA` is a **predecessor** of `wordB` if and only if we can insert **exactly one** letter anywhere in `wordA` **without changing the order of the other characters** to make it equal to `wordB`.

*   For example, `"abc "` is a **predecessor** of `"abac "`, while `"cba "` is not a **predecessor** of `"bcad "`.

A **word chain** is a sequence of words `[word1, word2, ..., wordk]` with `k >= 1`, where `word1` is a **predecessor** of `word2`, `word2` is a **predecessor** of `word3`, and so on. A single word is trivially a **word chain** with `k == 1`.

Return _the **length** of the **longest possible word chain** with words chosen from the given list of_ `words`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = \[ "a ", "b ", "ba ", "bca ", "bda ", "bdca "\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation**: One of the longest word chains is \[ "a ", "ba ", "bda ", "bdca "\].

Code Description: You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the `ith` stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:

*   If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed, and
*   If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y - x`.

At the end of the game, there is **at most one** stone left.

Return _the smallest possible weight of the left stone_. If there are no stones left, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stones = \[2,7,4,1,8,1\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:**
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to \[2,7,1,8,1\] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to \[2,1,1,1\] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array converts to \[1,1,1\] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array converts to \[1\], then that's the optimal value.

    # Problem Description3
    Given an integer array `nums`, return _the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence_.

    A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3,6,2,7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]`.

    **Example 1:**

    **Input:** nums = \[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18\]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** The longest increasing subsequence is \[2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

    **Example 2:**

    **Input:** nums = \[0,1,0,3,2,3\]
    **Output:** 4

    **Example 3:**

    **Input:** nums = \[7,7,7,7\]
    **Output:** 1

    **Constraints:**

    *   `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
    *   `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

Question ID: 1092
Code Description: Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return _the shortest string that has both_ `str1` _and_ `str2` _as **subsequences**_. If there are multiple valid strings, return **any** of them.

A string `s` is a **subsequence** of string `t` if deleting some number of characters from `t` (possibly `0`) results in the string `s`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** str1 =  "abac ", str2 =  "cab "
**Output:**  "cabac "
**Explanation:** 
str1 =  "abac " is a subsequence of  "cabac " because we can delete the first  "c ".
str2 =  "cab " is a subsequence of  "cabac " because we can delete the last  "ac ".
The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** str1 =  "aaaaaaaa ", str2 =  "aaaaaaaa "
**Output:**  "aaaaaaaa "

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000`
*   `str1` and `str2` consist of lowercase English letters.

Question ID: 1105
Code Description: You are given an array `books` where `books[i] = [thicknessi, heighti]` indicates the thickness and height of the `ith` book. You are also given an integer `shelfWidth`.

We want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have a total width `shelfWidth`.

We choose some of the books to place on this shelf such that the sum of their thickness is less than or equal to `shelfWidth`, then build another level of the shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down. We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.

Note that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books.

*   For example, if we have an ordered list of `5` books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.

Return _the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** books = \[\[1,1\],\[2,3\],\[2,3\],\[1,1\],\[1,1\],\[1,1\],\[1,2\]\], shelfWidth = 4
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:**
The sum of the heights of the 3 shelves is 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
Notice that book number 2 does not have to be on the first shelf.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** books = \[\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[3,2\]\], shelfWidth = 6
**Output:** 4

Code Description: Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are a number of piles **arranged in a row**, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`. The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. Initially, `M = 1`.

On each player's turn, that player can take **all the stones** in the **first** `X` remaining piles, where `1 <= X <= 2M`. Then, we set `M = max(M, X)`.

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** piles = \[2,7,9,4,4\]
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:**  If Alice takes one pile at the beginning, Bob takes two piles, then Alice takes 2 piles again. Alice can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alice takes two piles at the beginning, then Bob can take all three piles left. In this case, Alice get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since it's larger.

Question ID: 1186
Code Description: Given an array of integers, return the maximum sum for a **non-empty** subarray (contiguous elements) with at most one element deletion. In other words, you want to choose a subarray and optionally delete one element from it so that there is still at least one element left and the sum of the remaining elements is maximum possible.

Note that the subarray needs to be **non-empty** after deleting one element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[1,-2,0,3\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Because we can choose \[1, -2, 0, 3\] and drop -2, thus the subarray \[1, 0, 3\] becomes the maximum value.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = \[1,-2,-2,3\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We just choose \[3\] and it's the maximum sum.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = \[-1,-1,-1,-1\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** The final subarray needs to be non-empty. You can't choose \[-1\] and delete -1 from it, then get an empty subarray to make the sum equals to 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= arr.length <= 105`
*   `-104 <= arr[i] <= 104`

Code Description: A die simulator generates a random number from `1` to `6` for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number `i` more than `rollMax[i]` (**1-indexed**) consecutive times.

Given an array of integers `rollMax` and an integer `n`, return _the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact_ `n` _rolls_. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2, rollMax = \[1,1,2,2,2,3\]
**Output:** 34
**Explanation:** There will be 2 rolls of die, if there are no constraints on the die, there are 6 \* 6 = 36 possible combinations. In this case, looking at rollMax array, the numbers 1 and 2 appear at most once consecutively, therefore sequences (1,1) and (2,2) cannot occur, so the final answer is 36-2 = 34.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2, rollMax = \[1,1,1,1,1,1\]

Question ID: 1340
Code Description: Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `d`. In one step you can jump from index `i` to index:

*   `i + x` where: `i + x < arr.length` and `0 < x <= d`.
*   `i - x` where: `i - x >= 0` and `0 < x <= d`.

In addition, you can only jump from index `i` to index `j` if `arr[i] > arr[j]` and `arr[i] > arr[k]` for all indices `k` between `i` and `j` (More formally `min(i, j) < k < max(i, j)`).

You can choose any index of the array and start jumping. Return _the maximum number of indices_ you can visit.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[6,4,14,6,8,13,9,7,10,6,12\], d = 2
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** You can start at index 10. You can jump 10 --> 8 --> 6 --> 7 as shown.
Note that if you start at index 6 you can only jump to index 7. You cannot jump to index 5 because 13 > 9. You cannot jump to index 4 because index 5 is between index 4 and 6 and 13 > 9.
Similarly You cannot jump from index 3 to index 2 or index 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = \[3,3,3,3,3\], d = 3
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** You can start at any index. You always cannot jump to any index.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = \[7,6,5,4,3,2,1\], d = 1
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Start at index 0. You can visit all the indicies.

Code Description: Given the strings `s1` and `s2` of size `n` and the string `evil`, return _the number of **good** strings_.

A **good** string has size `n`, it is alphabetically greater than or equal to `s1`, it is alphabetically smaller than or equal to `s2`, and it does not contain the string `evil` as a substring. Since the answer can be a huge number, return this **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2, s1 =  "aa ", s2 =  "da ", evil =  "b "
**Output:** 51 
**Explanation:** There are 25 good strings starting with 'a':  "aa ", "ac ", "ad ",..., "az ". Then there are 25 good strings starting with 'c':  "ca ", "cc ", "cd ",..., "cz " and finally there is one good string starting with 'd':  "da ". 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 8, s1 =  "leetcode ", s2 =  "leetgoes ", evil =  "leet "
**Output:** 0 
**Explanation:** All strings greater than or equal to s1 and smaller than or equal to s2 start with the prefix  "leet ", therefore, there is not any good string.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 2, s1 =  "gx ", s2 =  "gz ", evil =  "x "
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

*   `s1.length == n`

Code Description: A chef has collected data on the `satisfaction` level of his `n` dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.

**Like-time coefficient** of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. `time[i] * satisfaction[i]`.

Return _the maximum sum of **like-time coefficient** that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation_.

Dishes can be prepared in **any** order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** satisfaction = \[-1,-8,0,5,-9\]
**Output:** 14
**Explanation:** After Removing the second and last dish, the maximum total **like-time coefficient** will be equal to (-1\*1 + 0\*2 + 5\*3 = 14).
Each dish is prepared in one unit of time.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** satisfaction = \[4,3,2\]
**Output:** 20
**Explanation:** Dishes can be prepared in any order, (2\*1 + 3\*2 + 4\*3 = 20)

**Example 3:**

**Input:** satisfaction = \[-1,-4,-5\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** People do not like the dishes. No dish is prepared.

Code Description: Given an array of integers `cost` and an integer `target`, return _the **maximum** integer you can paint under the following rules_:

*   The cost of painting a digit `(i + 1)` is given by `cost[i]` (**0-indexed**).
*   The total cost used must be equal to `target`.
*   The integer does not have `0` digits.

Since the answer may be very large, return it as a string. If there is no way to paint any integer given the condition, return `"0 "`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** cost = \[4,3,2,5,6,7,2,5,5\], target = 9
**Output:**  "7772 "
**Explanation:** The cost to paint the digit '7' is 2, and the digit '2' is 3. Then cost( "7772 ") = 2\*3+ 3\*1 = 9. You could also paint  "977 ", but  "7772 " is the largest number.

  9  ->   5

**Example 2:**

**Input:** cost = \[7,6,5,5,5,6,8,7,8\], target = 12
**Output:**  "85 "
**Explanation:** The cost to paint the digit '8' is 7, and the digit '5' is 5. Then cost( "85 ") = 7 + 5 = 12.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** cost = \[2,4,6,2,4,6,4,4,4\], target = 5
**Output:**  "0 "
**Explanation:** It is impossible to paint any integer with total cost equal to target.

Question ID: 1458
Code Description: Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.

Return the maximum dot product between **non-empty** subsequences of nums1 and nums2 with the same length.

A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `[2,3,5]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,3,4,5]` while `[1,5,3]` is not).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[2,1,-2,5\], nums2 = \[3,0,-6\]
**Output:** 18
**Explanation:** Take subsequence \[2,-2\] from nums1 and subsequence \[3,-6\] from nums2.
Their dot product is (2\*3 + (-2)\*(-6)) = 18.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[3,-2\], nums2 = \[2,-6,7\]
**Output:** 21
**Explanation:** Take subsequence \[3\] from nums1 and subsequence \[7\] from nums2.
Their dot product is (3\*7) = 21.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[-1,-1\], nums2 = \[1,1\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** Take subsequence \[-1\] from nums1 and subsequence \[1\] from nums2.
Their dot product is -1.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 500`
*   `-1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`

Question ID: 1463
Code Description: You are given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` representing a field of cherries where `grid[i][j]` represents the number of cherries that you can collect from the `(i, j)` cell.

You have two robots that can collect cherries for you:

*   **Robot #1** is located at the **top-left corner** `(0, 0)`, and
*   **Robot #2** is located at the **top-right corner** `(0, cols - 1)`.

Return _the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots by following the rules below_:

*   From a cell `(i, j)`, robots can move to cell `(i + 1, j - 1)`, `(i + 1, j)`, or `(i + 1, j + 1)`.
*   When any robot passes through a cell, It picks up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell.

Question ID: 1473
Code Description: There is a row of `m` houses in a small city, each house must be painted with one of the `n` colors (labeled from `1` to `n`), some houses that have been painted last summer should not be painted again.

A neighborhood is a maximal group of continuous houses that are painted with the same color.

*   For example: `houses = [1,2,2,3,3,2,1,1]` contains `5` neighborhoods `[{1}, {2,2}, {3,3}, {2}, {1,1}]`.

Given an array `houses`, an `m x n` matrix `cost` and an integer `target` where:

*   `houses[i]`: is the color of the house `i`, and `0` if the house is not painted yet.
*   `cost[i][j]`: is the cost of paint the house `i` with the color `j + 1`.

Return _the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses in such a way that there are exactly_ `target` _neighborhoods_. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** houses = \[0,0,0,0,0\], cost = \[\[1,10\],\[10,1\],\[10,1\],\[1,10\],\[5,1\]\], m = 5, n = 2, target = 3
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** Paint houses of this way \[1,2,2,1,1\]
This array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, \[{1}, {2,2}, {1,1}\].
Cost of paint all houses (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5) = 9.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** houses = \[0,2,1,2,0\], cost = \[\[1,10\],\[10,1\],\[10,1\],\[1,10\],\[5,1\]\], m = 5, n = 2, target = 3
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** Some houses are already painted, Paint the houses of this way \[2,2,1,2,2\]
This array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, \[{2,2}, {1}, {2,2}\]. 
Cost of paint the first and last house (10 + 1) = 11.

**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** Houses are already painted with a total of 4 neighborhoods \[{3},{1},{2},{3}\] different of target = 3.

*   `n == cost[i].length`
*   `1 <= m <= 100`
*   `1 <= n <= 20`
*   `1 <= target <= m`

Question ID: 1477
Code Description: You are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`.

You have to find **two non-overlapping sub-arrays** of `arr` each with a sum equal `target`. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is **minimum**.

Return _the minimum sum of the lengths_ of the two required sub-arrays, or return `-1` if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[3,2,2,4,3\], target = 3

**Explanation:** Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 (\[3\] and \[3\]). The sum of their lengths is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = \[7,3,4,7\], target = 7
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 (\[7\], \[3,4\] and \[7\]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = \[4,3,2,6,2,3,4\], target = 6

Question ID: 1510
Code Description: Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a _move_ consisting of removing **any** non-zero **square number** of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`, return `true` if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return `false`, assuming both players play optimally.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 4
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 105`

In one operation you can choose **any** subarray from `initial` and increment each value by one.

Return _the minimum number of operations to form a_ `target` _array from_ `initial`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** target = \[1,2,3,2,1\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We need at least 3 operations to form the target array from the initial array.

    Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the number of unique_ `k-diff` _pairs in the array_.

    A `k-diff` pair is an integer pair `(nums[i], nums[j])`, where the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is `k`.

    **Example 1:**

    **Input:** nums = [3,1,4,1,5], k = 2
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).

Question ID: 1531
Code Description: [Run-length encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string `"aabccc "` we replace `"aa "` by `"a2 "` and replace `"ccc "` by `"c3 "`. Thus the compressed string becomes `"a2bc3 "`.

Notice that in this problem, we are not adding `'1'` after single characters.

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You need to delete **at most** `k` characters from `s` such that the run-length encoded version of `s` has minimum length.

Find the _minimum length of the run-length encoded version of_ `s` _after deleting at most_ `k` _characters_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "aaabcccd ", k = 2
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Compressing s without deleting anything will give us  "a3bc3d " of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s =  "abcccd " which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be  "a3c3 " of length 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "aabbaa ", k = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be  "a4 " of length 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "aaaaaaaaaaa ", k = 0
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything. The compressed string is  "a11 " of length 3.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= k <= s.length`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

Question ID: 1537
Code Description: You are given two **sorted** arrays of distinct integers `nums1` and `nums2.`

A **valid path** is defined as follows:

*   Choose array `nums1` or `nums2` to traverse (from index-0).
*   Traverse the current array from left to right.
*   If you are reading any value that is present in `nums1` and `nums2` you are allowed to change your path to the other array. (Only one repeated value is considered in the valid path).

The **score** is defined as the sum of uniques values in a valid path.

Return _the maximum score you can obtain of all possible **valid paths**_. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[2,4,5,8,10\], nums2 = \[4,6,8,9\]

**Explanation:** Valid paths:
\[2,4,5,8,10\], \[2,4,5,8,9\], \[2,4,6,8,9\], \[2,4,6,8,10\],  (starting from nums1)
\[4,6,8,9\], \[4,5,8,10\], \[4,5,8,9\], \[4,6,8,10\]    (starting from nums2)
The maximum is obtained with the path in green **\[2,4,6,8,10\]**.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,3,5,7,9\], nums2 = \[3,5,100\]
**Output:** 109

Question ID: 1547
Code Description: Given a wooden stick of length `n` units. The stick is labelled from `0` to `n`. For example, a stick of length **6** is labelled as follows:

Given an integer array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` denotes a position you should perform a cut at.

You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.

The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.

Return _the minimum total cost_ of the cuts.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 7, cuts = \[1,3,4,5\]
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:** Using cuts order = \[1, 3, 4, 5\] as in the input leads to the following scenario:
 
The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.
Rearranging the cuts to be \[3, 5, 1, 4\] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 9, cuts = \[5,6,1,4,2\]
**Output:** 22
**Explanation:** If you try the given cuts ordering the cost will be 25.
There are much ordering with total cost <= 25, for example, the order \[4, 6, 5, 2, 1\] has total cost = 22 which is the minimum possible.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 106`
*   `1 <= cuts.length <= min(n - 1, 100)`
*   `1 <= cuts[i] <= n - 1`
*   All the integers in `cuts` array are **distinct**.

Code Description: There are `n` oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these oranges every day as follows:

*   Eat one orange.
*   If the number of remaining oranges `n` is divisible by `2` then you can eat `n / 2` oranges.
*   If the number of remaining oranges `n` is divisible by `3` then you can eat `2 * (n / 3)` oranges.

You can only choose one of the actions per day.

Given the integer `n`, return _the minimum number of days to eat_ `n` _oranges_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 10
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** You have 10 oranges.
Day 1: Eat 1 orange,  10 - 1 = 9.  
Day 2: Eat 6 oranges, 9 - 2\*(9/3) = 9 - 6 = 3. (Since 9 is divisible by 3)
Day 3: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2\*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. 
Day 4: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.
You need at least 4 days to eat the 10 oranges.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 6
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** You have 6 oranges.
Day 1: Eat 3 oranges, 6 - 6/2 = 6 - 3 = 3. (Since 6 is divisible by 2).
Day 2: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2\*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. (Since 3 is divisible by 3)

Question ID: 1563
Code Description: There are several stones **arranged in a row**, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array `stoneValue`.

In each round of the game, Alice divides the row into **two non-empty rows** (i.e. left row and right row), then Bob calculates the value of each row which is the sum of the values of all the stones in this row. Bob throws away the row which has the maximum value, and Alice's score increases by the value of the remaining row. If the value of the two rows are equal, Bob lets Alice decide which row will be thrown away. The next round starts with the remaining row.

The game ends when there is only **one stone remaining**. Alice's is initially **zero**.

Return _the maximum score that Alice can obtain_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stoneValue = \[6,2,3,4,5,5\]
**Output:** 18
**Explanation:** In the first round, Alice divides the row to \[6,2,3\], \[4,5,5\]. The left row has the value 11 and the right row has value 14. Bob throws away the right row and Alice's score is now 11.
In the second round Alice divides the row to \[6\], \[2,3\]. This time Bob throws away the left row and Alice's score becomes 16 (11 + 5).
The last round Alice has only one choice to divide the row which is \[2\], \[3\]. Bob throws away the right row and Alice's score is now 18 (16 + 2). The game ends because only one stone is remaining in the row.

Code Description: Given an array `nums` that represents a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. We are going to construct a binary search tree (BST) by inserting the elements of `nums` in order into an initially empty BST. Find the number of different ways to reorder `nums` so that the constructed BST is identical to that formed from the original array `nums`.

*   For example, given `nums = [2,1,3]`, we will have 2 as the root, 1 as a left child, and 3 as a right child. The array `[2,3,1]` also yields the same BST but `[3,2,1]` yields a different BST.

Return _the number of ways to reorder_ `nums` _such that the BST formed is identical to the original BST formed from_ `nums`.

Since the answer may be very large, **return it modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,1,3\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We can reorder nums to be \[2,3,1\] which will yield the same BST. There are no other ways to reorder nums which will yield the same BST.

**Input:** nums = \[3,4,5,1,2\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The following 5 arrays will yield the same BST: 
\[3,1,2,4,5\]
\[3,1,4,2,5\]
\[3,1,4,5,2\]
\[3,4,1,2,5\]
\[3,4,1,5,2\]

Question ID: 1575
Code Description: You are given an array of **distinct** positive integers locations where `locations[i]` represents the position of city `i`. You are also given integers `start`, `finish` and `fuel` representing the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.

At each step, if you are at city `i`, you can pick any city `j` such that `j != i` and `0 <= j < locations.length` and move to city `j`. Moving from city `i` to city `j` reduces the amount of fuel you have by `|locations[i] - locations[j]|`. Please notice that `|x|` denotes the absolute value of `x`.

Notice that `fuel` **cannot** become negative at any point in time, and that you are **allowed** to visit any city more than once (including `start` and `finish`).

Return _the count of all possible routes from_ `start` _to_ `finish`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** locations = \[2,3,6,8,4\], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The following are all possible routes, each uses 5 units of fuel:
1 -> 3
1 -> 2 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** locations = \[4,3,1\], start = 1, finish = 0, fuel = 6
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The following are all possible routes:
1 -> 0, used fuel = 1
1 -> 2 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 3
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5

**Example 3:**

**Input:** locations = \[5,2,1\], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 3

*   Change the rightmost (`0th`) bit in the binary representation of `n`.
*   Change the `ith` bit in the binary representation of `n` if the `(i-1)th` bit is set to `1` and the `(i-2)th` through `0th` bits are set to `0`.

Return _the minimum number of operations to transform_ `n` _into_ `0`_._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 3 is  "11 ".
 "11 " ->  "01 " with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
 "01 " ->  "00 " with the 1st operation.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 6
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 6 is  "110 ".
 "110 " ->  "010 " with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.
 "010 " ->  "011 " with the 1st operation.
 "011 " ->  "001 " with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
 "001 " ->  "000 " with the 1st operation.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= n <= 109`

    # Problem Description3
    Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the number of unique_ `k-diff` _pairs in the array_.

    A `k-diff` pair is an integer pair `(nums[i], nums[j])`, where the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is `k`.

    **Example 1:**

    **Input:** nums = [3,1,4,1,5], k = 2
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).
    Although we have two 1s in the input, we should only return the number of unique pairs.

    **Example 2:**

    **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** There are four 1-diff pairs in the array, (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4) and (4, 5).

    **Example 3:**

    **Input:** nums = [1,3,1,5,4], k = 0
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** There is one 0-diff pair in the array, (1, 1).

    **Constraints:**

    *   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
    *   `-107 <= nums[i] <= 107`
    *   `0 <= k <= 10

Question ID: 1617
Code Description: There are `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are given an array `edges` of size `n-1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` represents a bidirectional edge between cities `ui` and `vi`. There exists a unique path between each pair of cities. In other words, the cities form a **tree**.

A **subtree** is a subset of cities where every city is reachable from every other city in the subset, where the path between each pair passes through only the cities from the subset. Two subtrees are different if there is a city in one subtree that is not present in the other.

For each `d` from `1` to `n-1`, find the number of subtrees in which the **maximum distance** between any two cities in the subtree is equal to `d`.

Return _an array of size_ `n-1` _where the_ `dth` _element **(1-indexed)** is the number of subtrees in which the **maximum distance** between any two cities is equal to_ `d`.

**Notice** that the **distance** between the two cities is the number of edges in the path between them.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = \[\[1,2\],\[2,3\],\[2,4\]\]
**Output:** \[3,4,0\]
**Explanation:**
The subtrees with subsets {1,2}, {2,3} and {2,4} have a max distance of 1.
The subtrees with subsets {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {2,3,4} and {1,2,3,4} have a max distance of 2.
No subtree has two nodes where the max distance between them is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2, edges = \[\[1,2\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = \[\[1,2\],\[2,3\]\]
**Output:** \[2,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 15`
*   `edges.length == n-1`
*   `edges[i].length == 2`
*   `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
*   All pairs `(ui, vi)` are distinct.
Generated Code:

Code Description: Given `n` points on a 1-D plane, where the `ith` point (from `0` to `n-1`) is at `x = i`, find the number of ways we can draw **exactly** `k` **non-overlapping** line segments such that each segment covers two or more points. The endpoints of each segment must have **integral coordinates**. The `k` line segments **do not** have to cover all `n` points, and they are **allowed** to share endpoints.

Return _the number of ways we can draw_ `k` _non-overlapping line segments__._ Since this number can be huge, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, k = 2

Question ID: 1659
Code Description: You are given four integers, `m`, `n`, `introvertsCount`, and `extrovertsCount`. You have an `m x n` grid, and there are two types of people: introverts and extroverts. There are `introvertsCount` introverts and `extrovertsCount` extroverts.

You should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of them one grid cell. Note that you **do not** have to have all the people living in the grid.

The **happiness** of each person is calculated as follows:

*   Introverts **start** with `120` happiness and **lose** `30` happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).
*   Extroverts **start** with `40` happiness and **gain** `20` happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Neighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.

The **grid happiness** is the **sum** of each person's happiness. Return _the **maximum possible grid happiness**._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 2, n = 3, introvertsCount = 1, extrovertsCount = 2
**Output:** 240
**Explanation:** Assume the grid is 1-indexed with coordinates (row, column).
We can put the introvert in cell (1,1) and put the extroverts in cells (1,3) and (2,3).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 \* 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Extrovert at (1,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 \* 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
- Extrovert at (2,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 \* 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
The grid happiness is 120 + 60 + 60 = 240.
The above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1
**Output:** 260
**Explanation:** Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 \* 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 \* 20) (2 neighbors) = 80
- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 \* 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
The grid happiness is 90 + 80 + 90 = 260.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** m = 2, n = 2, introvertsCount = 4, extrovertsCount = 0
**Output:** 240

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m, n <= 5`
*   `0 <= introvertsCount, extrovertsCount <= min(m * n, 6)`
Generated Code:
 introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1
**Output:** 260
**Explanation:** Place the introverts in the top two rows and the extrovert in the middle row.
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 \* 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Introvert at (2,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 \* 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 \* 20) (2 neighbors) = 100
The grid happiness is 90 + 90 + 100 = 280.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** m = 2, n = 2, introvertsCount = 4, extrovertsCount = 0
**Output:** 440
**Explanation:** Place the introverts in any of the four cells.
- Introverts at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (3 \* 30) (3 neighbors) = 90
The grid happiness is 4 * 90 = 360.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m, n <= 50`
*   `0 <= introvertsCount, extrovertsCount <= min(m*n, 6)`

Question ID: 1690
Code Description: Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with **Alice starting first**.

There are `n` stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, they can **remove** either the leftmost stone or the rightmost stone from the row and receive points equal to the **sum** of the remaining stones' values in the row. The winner is the one with the higher score when there are no stones left to remove.

Bob found that he will always lose this game (poor Bob, he always loses), so he decided to **minimize the score's difference**. Alice's goal is to **maximize the difference** in the score.

Given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` represents the value of the `ith` stone **from the left**, return _the **difference** in Alice and Bob's score if they both play **optimally**._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stones = \[5,3,1,4,2\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** 
- Alice removes 2 and gets 5 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 13 points. Alice = 13, Bob = 0, stones = \[5,3,1,4\].
- Bob removes 5 and gets 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 points. Alice = 13, Bob = 8, stones = \[3,1,4\].
- Alice removes 3 and gets 1 + 4 = 5 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 8, stones = \[1,4\].
- Bob removes 1 and gets 4 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 12, stones = \[4\].
- Alice removes 4 and gets 0 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 12, stones = \[\].
The score difference is 18 - 12 = 6.

Question ID: 1728
Code Description: A game is played by a cat and a mouse named Cat and Mouse.

The environment is represented by a `grid` of size `rows x cols`, where each element is a wall, floor, player (Cat, Mouse), or food.

*   Players are represented by the characters `'C'`(Cat)`,'M'`(Mouse).
*   Floors are represented by the character `'.'` and can be walked on.
*   Walls are represented by the character `'#'` and cannot be walked on.
*   Food is represented by the character `'F'` and can be walked on.
*   There is only one of each character `'C'`, `'M'`, and `'F'` in `grid`.

Mouse and Cat play according to the following rules:

*   Mouse **moves first**, then they take turns to move.
*   During each turn, Cat and Mouse can jump in one of the four directions (left, right, up, down). They cannot jump over the wall nor outside of the `grid`.
*   `catJump, mouseJump` are the maximum lengths Cat and Mouse can jump at a time, respectively. Cat and Mouse can jump less than the maximum length.
*   Staying in the same position is allowed.
*   Mouse can jump over Cat.

The game can end in 4 ways:

*   If Cat occupies the same position as Mouse, Cat wins.
*   If Cat reaches the food first, Cat wins.
*   If Mouse reaches the food first, Mouse wins.
*   If Mouse cannot get to the food within 1000 turns, Cat wins.

Given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` and two integers `catJump` and `mouseJump`, return `true` _if Mouse can win the game if both Cat and Mouse play optimally, otherwise return_ `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[ "####F ", "#C... ", "M.... "\], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 2

Question ID: 1751
Code Description: You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]`. The `ith` event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the **entire** event. Note that the end day is **inclusive**: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.

Return _the **maximum sum** of values that you can receive by attending events._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** events = \[\[1,2,4\],\[3,4,3\],\[2,3,1\]\], k = 2
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Choose the green events, 0 and 1 (0-indexed) for a total value of 4 + 3 = 7.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** events = \[\[1,2,4\],\[3,4,3\],\[2,3,10\]\], k = 2
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** Choose event 2 for a total value of 10.
Notice that you cannot attend any other event as they overlap, and that you do **not** have to attend k events.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** events = \[\[1,1,1\],\[2,2,2\],\[3,3,3\],\[4,4,4\]\], k = 3
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** Although the events do not overlap, you can only attend 3 events. Pick the highest valued three.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= k <= events.length`
*   `1 <= k * events.length <= 106`
*   `1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 109`
*   `1 <= valuei <= 106`

Code Description: You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `goal`.

You want to choose a subsequence of `nums` such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to `goal`. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is `sum`, then you want to **minimize the absolute difference** `abs(sum - goal)`.

Return _the **minimum** possible value of_ `abs(sum - goal)`.

Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements **(possibly all or none)** of the original array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[5,-7,3,5\], goal = 6
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6.
This is equal to the goal, so the absolute difference is 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[7,-9,15,-2\], goal = -5
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Choose the subsequence \[7,-9,-2\], with a sum of -4.
The absolute difference is abs(-4 - (-5)) = abs(1) = 1, which is the minimum.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\], goal = -7
**Output:** 7

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 40`

Code Description: You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums` and `multipliers` of size `n` and `m` respectively, where `n >= m`.

You begin with a score of `0`. You want to perform **exactly** `m` operations. On the `ith` operation (**0-indexed**) you will:

*   Choose one integer `x` from **either the start or the end** of the array `nums`.
*   Add `multipliers[i] * x` to your score.
    *   Note that `multipliers[0]` corresponds to the first operation, `multipliers[1]` to the second operation, and so on.
*   Remove `x` from `nums`.

Return _the **maximum** score after performing_ `m` _operations._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\], multipliers = \[3,2,1\]
**Output:** 14
**Explanation:** An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the end, \[1,2,**3**\], adding 3 \* 3 = 9 to the score.
- Choose from the end, \[1,**2**\], adding 2 \* 2 = 4 to the score.
- Choose from the end, \[**1**\], adding 1 \* 1 = 1 to the score.
The total score is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1\], multipliers = \[-10,-5,3,4,6\]
**Output:** 102
**Explanation:** An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the start, \[**\-5**,-3,-3,-2,7,1\], adding -5 \* -10 = 50 to the score.
- Choose from the start, \[**\-3**,-3,-2,7,1\], adding -3 \* -5 = 15 to the score.

- Choose from the end, \[-2,7,**1**\], adding 1 \* 4 = 4 to the score.
- Choose from the end, \[-2,**7**\], adding 7 \* 6 = 42 to the score.

Code Description: You are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string in the following manner:

*   Choose some **non-empty** subsequence `subsequence1` from `word1`.
*   Choose some **non-empty** subsequence `subsequence2` from `word2`.
*   Concatenate the subsequences: `subsequence1 + subsequence2`, to make the string.

Return _the **length** of the longest **palindrome** that can be constructed in the described manner._ If no palindromes can be constructed, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string `s` is a string that can be made by deleting some (possibly none) characters from `s` without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward as well as backward.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word1 =  "cacb ", word2 =  "cbba "
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Choose  "ab " from word1 and  "cba " from word2 to make  "abcba ", which is a palindrome.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word1 =  "ab ", word2 =  "ab "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Choose  "ab " from word1 and  "a " from word2 to make  "aba ", which is a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** word1 =  "aa ", word2 =  "bb "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** You cannot construct a palindrome from the described method, so return 0.

Question ID: 1786
Code Description: There is an undirected weighted connected graph. You are given a positive integer `n` which denotes that the graph has `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, and an array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi, weighti]` denotes that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` with weight equal to `weighti`.

A path from node `start` to node `end` is a sequence of nodes `[z0, z1, z2, ..., zk]` such that `z0 = start` and `zk = end` and there is an edge between `zi` and `zi+1` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.

The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path. Let `distanceToLastNode(x)` denote the shortest distance of a path between node `n` and node `x`. A **restricted path** is a path that also satisfies that `distanceToLastNode(zi) > distanceToLastNode(zi+1)` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.

Return _the number of restricted paths from node_ `1` _to node_ `n`. Since that number may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

Question ID: 1799
Code Description: You are given `nums`, an array of positive integers of size `2 * n`. You must perform `n` operations on this array.

In the `ith` operation **(1-indexed)**, you will:

*   Choose two elements, `x` and `y`.
*   Receive a score of `i * gcd(x, y)`.
*   Remove `x` and `y` from `nums`.

Return _the maximum score you can receive after performing_ `n` _operations._

The function `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The optimal choice of operations is:
(1 \* gcd(1, 2)) = 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,4,6,8\]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The optimal choice of operations is:
(1 \* gcd(3, 6)) + (2 \* gcd(4, 8)) = 3 + 8 = 11

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4,5,6\]
**Output:** 14
**Explanation:** The optimal choice of operations is:
(1 \* gcd(1, 5)) + (2 \* gcd(2, 4)) + (3 \* gcd(3, 6)) = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14

Question ID: 1824
Code Description: There is a **3 lane road** of length `n` that consists of `n + 1` **points** labeled from `0` to `n`. A frog **starts** at point `0` in the **second** lane and wants to jump to point `n`. However, there could be obstacles along the way.

You are given an array `obstacles` of length `n + 1` where each `obstacles[i]` (**ranging from 0 to 3**) describes an obstacle on the lane `obstacles[i]` at point `i`. If `obstacles[i] == 0`, there are no obstacles at point `i`. There will be **at most one** obstacle in the 3 lanes at each point.

*   For example, if `obstacles[2] == 1`, then there is an obstacle on lane 1 at point 2.

The frog can only travel from point `i` to point `i + 1` on the same lane if there is not an obstacle on the lane at point `i + 1`. To avoid obstacles, the frog can also perform a **side jump** to jump to **another** lane (even if they are not adjacent) at the **same** point if there is no obstacle on the new lane.

*   For example, the frog can jump from lane 3 at point 3 to lane 1 at point 3.

Return _the **minimum number of side jumps** the frog needs to reach **any lane** at point n starting from lane `2` at point 0._

**Note:** There will be no obstacles on points `0` and `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** obstacles = \[0,1,2,3,0\]
**Output:** 2 
**Explanation:** The optimal solution is shown by the arrows above. There are 2 side jumps (red arrows).
Note that the frog can jump over obstacles only when making side jumps (as shown at point 2).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** obstacles = \[0,1,1,3,3,0\]

Code Description: Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with **Alice starting first**.

There are `n` stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the number of stones is **more than one**, they will do the following:

1.  Choose an integer `x > 1`, and **remove** the leftmost `x` stones from the row.
2.  Add the **sum** of the **removed** stones' values to the player's score.
3.  Place a **new stone**, whose value is equal to that sum, on the left side of the row.

The game stops when **only** **one** stone is left in the row.

The **score difference** between Alice and Bob is `(Alice's score - Bob's score)`. Alice's goal is to **maximize** the score difference, and Bob's goal is the **minimize** the score difference.

Given an integer array `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i]` represents the value of the `ith` stone **from the left**, return _the **score difference** between Alice and Bob if they both play **optimally**._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stones = \[-1,2,-3,4,-5\]

**Explanation:**
- Alice removes the first 4 stones, adds (-1) + 2 + (-3) + 4 = 2 to her score, and places a stone of
  value 2 on the left. stones = \[2,-5\].
- Bob removes the first 2 stones, adds 2 + (-5) = -3 to his score, and places a stone of value -3 on

Question ID: 1884
Code Description: You are given **two identical** eggs and you have access to a building with `n` floors labeled from `1` to `n`.

You know that there exists a floor `f` where `0 <= f <= n` such that any egg dropped at a floor **higher** than `f` will **break**, and any egg dropped **at or below** floor `f` will **not break**.

In each move, you may take an **unbroken** egg and drop it from any floor `x` (where `1 <= x <= n`). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may **reuse** it in future moves.

Return _the **minimum number of moves** that you need to determine **with certainty** what the value of_ `f` is.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We can drop the first egg from floor 1 and the second egg from floor 2.
If the first egg breaks, we know that f = 0.
If the second egg breaks but the first egg didn't, we know that f = 1.
Otherwise, if both eggs survive, we know that f = 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 100
**Output:** 14
**Explanation:** One optimal strategy is:
- Drop the 1st egg at floor 9. If it breaks, we know f is between 0 and 8. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 1 and going up one at a time to find f within 8 more drops. Total drops is 1 + 8 = 9.
- If the 1st egg does not break, drop the 1st egg again at floor 22. If it breaks, we know f is between 9 and 21. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 10 and going up one at a time to find f within 12 more drops. Total drops is 2 + 12 = 14.
- If the 1st egg does not break again, follow a similar process dropping the 1st egg from floors 34, 45, 55, 64, 72, 79, 85, 90, 94, 97, 99, and 100.
Regardless of the outcome, it takes at most 14 drops to determine f.

Question ID: 1888
Code Description: You are given a binary string `s`. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:

*   **Type-1: Remove** the character at the start of the string `s` and **append** it to the end of the string.
*   **Type-2: Pick** any character in `s` and **flip** its value, i.e., if its value is `'0'` it becomes `'1'` and vice-versa.

Return _the **minimum** number of **type-2** operations you need to perform_ _such that_ `s` _becomes **alternating**._

The string is called **alternating** if no two adjacent characters are equal.

*   For example, the strings `"010 "` and `"1010 "` are alternating, while the string `"0100 "` is not.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "111000 "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation**: Use the first operation two times to make s =  "100011 ".
Then, use the second operation on the third and sixth elements to make s =  "101010 ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "010 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation**: The string is already alternating.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "1110 "
**Output:** 1
**Explanation**: Use the second operation on the second element to make s =  "1010 ".

**Constraints:**

Question ID: 1896
Code Description: You are given a **valid** boolean expression as a string `expression` consisting of the characters `'1'`,`'0'`,`'&'` (bitwise **AND** operator),`'|'` (bitwise **OR** operator),`'('`, and `')'`.

*   For example, `"()1|1 "` and `"(1)&() "` are **not valid** while `"1 "`, `"(((1))|(0)) "`, and `"1|(0&(1)) "` are **valid** expressions.

Return _the **minimum cost** to change the final value of the expression_.

*   For example, if `expression = "1|1|(0&0)&1 "`, its **value** is `1|1|(0&0)&1 = 1|1|0&1 = 1|0&1 = 1&1 = 1`. We want to apply operations so that the **new** expression evaluates to `0`.

The **cost** of changing the final value of an expression is the **number of operations** performed on the expression. The types of **operations** are described as follows:

*   Turn a `'1'` into a `'0'`.
*   Turn a `'0'` into a `'1'`.
*   Turn a `'&'` into a `'|'`.
*   Turn a `'|'` into a `'&'`.

**Note:** `'&'` does **not** take precedence over `'|'` in the **order of calculation**. Evaluate parentheses **first**, then in **left-to-right** order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** expression =  "1&(0|1) "
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We can turn  "1&(0**|**1) " into  "1&(0**&**1) " by changing the '|' to a '&' using 1 operation.
The new expression evaluates to 0. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** expression =  "(0&0)&(0&0&0) "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can turn  "(0**&0**)**&**(0&0&0) " into  "(0**|1**)**|**(0&0&0) " using 3 operations.
The new expression evaluates to 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** expression =  "(0|(1|0&1)) "
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We can turn  "(0|(**1**|0&1)) " into  "(0|(**0**|0&1)) " using 1 operation.
The new expression evaluates to 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= expression.length <= 105`
*   `expression` only contains `'1'`,`'0'`,`'&'`,`'|'`,`'('`, and `')'`
*   All parentheses are properly matched.
*   There will be no empty parentheses (i.e: `"() "` is not a substring of `expression`).
Generated Code:
0**)**&**(0&0&0) " by changing the '&' to a '|' using 2 operations. Then, the string can be simplified to "0**|**(0&0&0) ", which evaluates to 0. We can turn the '|' in the parentheses into a '&' using 1 operation. The final expression is "0**&**(0&0&0) ", which evaluates to 0.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** expression =  "(1|1)&(1|1) "
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We can turn  "(1|1)**&**(1|1) " into  "(1**|**1)**&**(1**|**1) " by changing the '&' to a '|' using 2 operations. The new expression evaluates to 1.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= expression.length <= 10000`
*   `expression[i]` is one of `'1'`, `'0'`, `'&'`, `'|'`, `'('`, and `')'`.

Question ID: 1900
Code Description: There is a tournament where `n` players are participating. The players are standing in a single row and are numbered from `1` to `n` based on their **initial** standing position (player `1` is the first player in the row, player `2` is the second player in the row, etc.).

The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number `1`). In each round, the `ith` player from the front of the row competes against the `ith` player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.

*   For example, if the row consists of players `1, 2, 4, 6, 7`
    *   Player `1` competes against player `7`.
    *   Player `2` competes against player `6`.
    *   Player `4` automatically advances to the next round.

After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the **original ordering** assigned to them initially (ascending order).

The players numbered `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may **choose** the outcome of this round.

Given the integers `n`, `firstPlayer`, and `secondPlayer`, return _an integer array containing two values, the **earliest** possible round number and the **latest** possible round number in which these two players will compete against each other, respectively_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 11, firstPlayer = 2, secondPlayer = 4
**Output:** \[3,4\]
**Explanation:**
One possible scenario which leads to the earliest round number:
First round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
Second round: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11
Third round: 2, 3, 4
One possible scenario which leads to the latest round number:
First round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
Second round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Third round: 1, 2, 4
Fourth round: 2, 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, firstPlayer = 1, secondPlayer = 5
**Output:** \[1,1\]
**Explanation:** The players numbered 1 and 5 compete in the first round.
There is no way to make them compete in any other round.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 28`
*   `1 <= firstPlayer < secondPlayer <= n`
Generated Code:
2, 4, 5, 6, 11
Third round: 1, 2, 4
Fourth round: 2, 4
So, the answer is \[3,4\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, firstPlayer = 1, secondPlayer = 5
**Output:** \[1,2\]
**Explanation:**
First round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Second round: 1, 5
So, the answer is \[1,2\].

Code Description: The **alternating sum** of a **0-indexed** array is defined as the **sum** of the elements at **even** indices **minus** the **sum** of the elements at **odd** indices.

*   For example, the alternating sum of `[4,2,5,3]` is `(4 + 5) - (2 + 3) = 4`.

Given an array `nums`, return _the **maximum alternating sum** of any subsequence of_ `nums` _(after **reindexing** the elements of the subsequence)_.

A **subsequence** of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, `[2,7,4]` is a subsequence of `[4,2,3,7,2,1,4]` (the underlined elements), while `[2,4,2]` is not.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,2,5,3\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** It is optimal to choose the subsequence \[4,2,5\] with alternating sum (4 + 5) - 2 = 7.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[5,6,7,8\]
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** It is optimal to choose the subsequence \[8\] with alternating sum 8.

**Example 3:**

Code Description: You are an ant tasked with adding `n` new rooms numbered `0` to `n-1` to your colony. You are given the expansion plan as a **0-indexed** integer array of length `n`, `prevRoom`, where `prevRoom[i]` indicates that you must build room `prevRoom[i]` before building room `i`, and these two rooms must be connected **directly**. Room `0` is already built, so `prevRoom[0] = -1`. The expansion plan is given such that once all the rooms are built, every room will be reachable from room `0`.

You can only build **one room** at a time, and you can travel freely between rooms you have **already built** only if they are **connected**. You can choose to build **any room** as long as its **previous room** is already built.

Question ID: 1928
Code Description: There is a country of `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` where **all the cities are connected** by bi-directional roads. The roads are represented as a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [xi, yi, timei]` denotes a road between cities `xi` and `yi` that takes `timei` minutes to travel. There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.

Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a **0-indexed** integer array `passingFees` of length `n` where `passingFees[j]` is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city `j`.

In the beginning, you are at city `0` and want to reach city `n - 1` in `maxTime` **minutes or less**. The **cost** of your journey is the **summation of passing fees** for each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey (**including** the source and destination cities).

Given `maxTime`, `edges`, and `passingFees`, return _the **minimum cost** to complete your journey, or_ `-1` _if you cannot complete it within_ `maxTime` _minutes_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** maxTime = 30, edges = \[\[0,1,10\],\[1,2,10\],\[2,5,10\],\[0,3,1\],\[3,4,10\],\[4,5,15\]\], passingFees = \[5,1,2,20,20,3\]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The path to take is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5, which takes 30 minutes and has $11 worth of passing fees.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** maxTime = 29, edges = \[\[0,1,10\],\[1,2,10\],\[2,5,10\],\[0,3,1\],\[3,4,10\],\[4,5,15\]\], passingFees = \[5,1,2,20,20,3\]
**Output:** 48
**Explanation:** The path to take is 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, which takes 26 minutes and has $48 worth of passing fees.
You cannot take path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 since it would take too long.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** maxTime = 25, edges = \[\[0,1,10\],\[1,2,10\],\[2,5,10\],\[0,3,1\],\[3,4,10\],\[4,5,15\]\], passingFees = \[5,1,2,20,20,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is no way to reach city 5 from city 0 within 25 minutes.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= maxTime <= 1000`
*   `n == passingFees.length`
*   `2 <= n <= 1000`
*   `n - 1 <= edges.length <= 1000`
*   `0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1`
*   `1 <= timei <= 1000`
*   `1 <= passingFees[j] <= 1000`
*   The graph may contain multiple edges between two nodes.
*   The graph does not contain self loops.

Question ID: 1947
Code Description: There is a survey that consists of `n` questions where each question's answer is either `0` (no) or `1` (yes).

The survey was given to `m` students numbered from `0` to `m - 1` and `m` mentors numbered from `0` to `m - 1`. The answers of the students are represented by a 2D integer array `students` where `students[i]` is an integer array that contains the answers of the `ith` student (**0-indexed**). The answers of the mentors are represented by a 2D integer array `mentors` where `mentors[j]` is an integer array that contains the answers of the `jth` mentor (**0-indexed**).

Each student will be assigned to **one** mentor, and each mentor will have **one** student assigned to them. The **compatibility score** of a student-mentor pair is the number of answers that are the same for both the student and the mentor.

*   For example, if the student's answers were `[1, 0, 1]` and the mentor's answers were `[0, 0, 1]`, then their compatibility score is 2 because only the second and the third answers are the same.

You are tasked with finding the optimal student-mentor pairings to **maximize** the **sum of the compatibility scores**.

Given `students` and `mentors`, return _the **maximum compatibility score sum** that can be achieved._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** students = \[\[1,1,0\],\[1,0,1\],\[0,0,1\]\], mentors = \[\[1,0,0\],\[0,0,1\],\[1,1,0\]\]
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** We assign students to mentors in the following way:
- student 0 to mentor 2 with a compatibility score of 3.
- student 1 to mentor 0 with a compatibility score of 2.
- student 2 to mentor 1 with a compatibility score of 3.
The compatibility score sum is 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** students = \[\[0,0\],\[0,0\],\[0,0\]\], mentors = \[\[1,1\],\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The compatibility score of any student-mentor pair is 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `m == students.length == mentors.length`
*   `n == students[i].length == mentors[j].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 8`
*   `students[i][k]` is either `0` or `1`.
*   `mentors[j][k]` is either `0` or `1`.
Generated Code:
,1\],\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The optimal student-mentor pairings result in a compatibility score sum of 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == students.length == mentors.length`
*   `n == students[i].length == mentors[i].length`
*   `1 <= n <= 12`
*   `students[i][j]`, `mentors[i][j]` are either 0 or 1.

Question ID: 1955
Code Description: A sequence is **special** if it consists of a **positive** number of `0`s, followed by a **positive** number of `1`s, then a **positive** number of `2`s.

*   For example, `[0,1,2]` and `[0,0,1,1,1,2]` are special.
*   In contrast, `[2,1,0]`, `[1]`, and `[0,1,2,0]` are not special.

Given an array `nums` (consisting of **only** integers `0`, `1`, and `2`), return _the **number of different subsequences** that are special_. Since the answer may be very large, **return it modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Two subsequences are **different** if the **set of indices** chosen are different.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,2,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The special subsequences are bolded \[**0**,**1**,**2**,2\], \[**0**,**1**,2,**2**\], and \[**0**,**1**,**2**,**2**\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,2,0,0\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are no special subsequences in \[2,2,0,0\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,2,0,1,2\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** The special subsequences are bolded:
- \[**0**,**1**,**2**,0,1,2\]
- \[**0**,**1**,2,0,1,**2**\]
- \[**0**,**1**,**2**,0,1,**2**\]
- \[**0**,**1**,2,0,**1**,**2**\]
- \[**0**,1,2,**0**,**1**,**2**\]
- \[**0**,1,2,0,**1**,**2**\]
- \[0,1,2,**0**,**1**,**2**\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 2`
Generated Code:
**0**,1,**2**\]
- \[**0**,1,2,**0**,**1**,**2**\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

Code Description: You are in a city that consists of `n` intersections numbered from `0` to `n - 1` with **bi-directional** roads between some intersections. The inputs are generated such that you can reach any intersection from any other intersection and that there is at most one road between any two intersections.

You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ui, vi, timei]` means that there is a road between intersections `ui` and `vi` that takes `timei` minutes to travel. You want to know in how many ways you can travel from intersection `0` to intersection `n - 1` in the **shortest amount of time**.

Return _the **number of ways** you can arrive at your destination in the **shortest amount of time**_. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 7, roads = \[\[0,6,7\],\[0,1,2\],\[1,2,3\],\[1,3,3\],\[6,3,3\],\[3,5,1\],\[6,5,1\],\[2,5,1\],\[0,4,5\],\[4,6,2\]\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The shortest amount of time it takes to go from intersection 0 to intersection 6 is 7 minutes.
The four ways to get there in 7 minutes are:
- 0 ➝ 6
- 0 ➝ 4 ➝ 6
- 0 ➝ 1 ➝ 2 ➝ 5 ➝ 6
- 0 ➝ 1 ➝ 3 ➝ 5 ➝ 6

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2, roads = \[\[1,0,10\]\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There is only one way to go from intersection 0 to intersection 1, and it takes 10 minutes.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 200`
*   `n - 1 <= roads.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
*   `roads[i].length == 3`
*   `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
*   `1 <= timei <= 109`
*   `ui != vi`
*   There is at most one road connecting any two intersections.
*   You can reach any intersection from any other intersection.

Code Description: There are `n` tasks assigned to you. The task times are represented as an integer array `tasks` of length `n`, where the `ith` task takes `tasks[i]` hours to finish. A **work session** is when you work for **at most** `sessionTime` consecutive hours and then take a break.

You should finish the given tasks in a way that satisfies the following conditions:

*   If you start a task in a work session, you must complete it in the **same** work session.
*   You can start a new task **immediately** after finishing the previous one.
*   You may complete the tasks in **any order**.

Given `tasks` and `sessionTime`, return _the **minimum** number of **work sessions** needed to finish all the tasks following the conditions above._

Question ID: 1987
Code Description: You are given a binary string `binary`. A **subsequence** of `binary` is considered **good** if it is **not empty** and has **no leading zeros** (with the exception of `"0 "`).

Find the number of **unique good subsequences** of `binary`.

*   For example, if `binary = "001 "`, then all the **good** subsequences are `[ "0 ", "0 ", "1 "]`, so the **unique** good subsequences are `"0 "` and `"1 "`. Note that subsequences `"00 "`, `"01 "`, and `"001 "` are not good because they have leading zeros.

Return _the number of **unique good subsequences** of_ `binary`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** binary =  "001 "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The good subsequences of binary are \[ "0 ",  "0 ",  "1 "\].
The unique good subsequences are  "0 " and  "1 ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** binary =  "11 "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The good subsequences of binary are \[ "1 ",  "1 ",  "11 "\].
The unique good subsequences are  "1 " and  "11 ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** binary =  "101 "
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The good subsequences of binary are \[ "1 ",  "0 ",  "1 ",  "10 ",  "11 ",  "101 "\]. 
The unique good subsequences are  "0 ",  "1 ",  "10 ",  "11 ", and  "101 ".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= binary.length <= 105`
*   `binary` consists of only `'0'`s and `'1'`s.

Question ID: 1994
Code Description: You are given an integer array `nums`. We call a subset of `nums` **good** if its product can be represented as a product of one or more **distinct prime** numbers.

*   For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`:
    *   `[2, 3]`, `[1, 2, 3]`, and `[1, 3]` are **good** subsets with products `6 = 2*3`, `6 = 2*3`, and `3 = 3` respectively.
    *   `[1, 4]` and `[4]` are not **good** subsets with products `4 = 2*2` and `4 = 2*2` respectively.

Return _the number of different **good** subsets in_ `nums` _**modulo**_ `109 + 7`.

A **subset** of `nums` is any array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) elements from `nums`. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The good subsets are:
- \[1,2\]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- \[1,2,3\]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- \[1,3\]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
- \[2\]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- \[2,3\]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- \[3\]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,2,3,15\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The good subsets are:
- \[2\]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- \[2,3\]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- \[2,15\]: product is 30, which is the product of distinct primes 2, 3, and 5.
- \[3\]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
- \[15\]: product is 15, which is the product of distinct primes 3 and 5.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 30`
Generated Code:

- \[3\]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
