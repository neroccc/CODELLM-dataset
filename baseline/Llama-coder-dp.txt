Question ID: 10
Code Description: Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:

*   `'.'` Matches any single character.​​​​
*   `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "a "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**  "a " does not match the entire string  "aa ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "a\* "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** '\*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes  "aa ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "ab ", p =  ".\* "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**  ".\* " means  "zero or more (\*) of any character (.) ".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 20`
*   `1 <= p.length <= 20`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
*   `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.
*   It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.

**Explanation:** The two most frequent elements are `1` and `2`, with a frequency of 3 and 2 respectively.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1\], k = 1
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
*   `nums.length == unique_elems`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`

**Follow up:** Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where `n = nums.length`.

Question ID: 55
Code Description: You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` _if you can reach the last index, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,1,1,4\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,1,0,4\]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`

Question ID: 87
Code Description: We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

1.  If the length of the string is 1, stop.
2.  If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
    *   Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`.
    *   **Randomly** decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.
    *   Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of **the same length**, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "great ", s2 =  "rgeat "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
 "great " -->  "gr/eat " // divide at random index.
 "gr/eat " -->  "gr/eat " // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
 "gr/eat " -->  "g/r / e/at " // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
 "g/r / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/at " // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
 "r/g / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide  "at " to  "a/t ".
 "r/g / e/ a/t " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is  "rgeat " which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "abcde ", s2 =  "caebd "
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  "a ", s2 =  "a "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `s1.length == s2.length`
*   `1 <= s1.length <= 30`
*   `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters.
Generated Code:

**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

    # Problem Description3
    Given a string `s`, return the number of **palindromic substrings** in it.

    A string is a **palindrome** if it reads the same backward as forward.

    A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

    **Example 1:**

    **Input:** s =  "abc"
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".

    **Example 2:**

    **Input:** s =  "aaa"
    **Output:** 6
    **Explanation:** Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".

Question ID: 91
Code Description: A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' ->  "1 "
'B' ->  "2 "
...
'Z' ->  "26 "

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11106 "` can be mapped into:

*   `"AAJF "` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
*   `"KJF "` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`

Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06 "` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6 "` is different from `"06 "`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return _the **number** of ways to **decode** it_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "12 "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**  "12 " could be decoded as  "AB " (1 2) or  "L " (12).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "226 "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**  "226 " could be decoded as  "BZ " (2 26),  "VF " (22 6), or  "BBF " (2 2 6).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "06 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:**  "06 " cannot be mapped to  "F " because of the leading zero ( "6 " is different from  "06 ").

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

Question ID: 97
Code Description: Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s1` and `s2`.

An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s` and `t` are divided into `n` and `m` substrings respectively, such that:

*   `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
*   `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
*   `|n - m| <= 1`
*   The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

**Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbcbcac "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 =  "aa " +  "bc " +  "c ", and s2 into s2 =  "dbbc " +  "a ".
Interleaving the two splits, we get  "aa " +  "dbbc " +  "bc " +  "a " +  "c " =  "aadbbcbcac ".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbbaccc "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  " ", s2 =  " ", s3 =  " "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= s3.length <= 200`
*   `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.

Code Description: Given a `triangle` array, return _the minimum path sum from top to bottom_.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index `i` on the current row, you may move to either index `i` or index `i + 1` on the next row.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** triangle = \[\[2\],\[3,4\],\[6,5,7\],\[4,1,8,3\]\]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The triangle looks like:
   2
  3 4
 6 5 7
4 1 8 3
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** triangle = \[\[-10\]\]
**Output:** -10

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= triangle.length <= 200`
*   `triangle[0].length == 1`
*   `triangle[i].length == triangle[i - 1].length + 1`
*   `-104 <= triangle[i][j] <= 104`

**Follow up:** Could you do this using only `O(n)` extra space, where `n` is the total number of rows in the triangle?

Code Description: You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,1,5,3,6,4\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,6,4,3,1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Question ID: 122
Code Description: You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,1,5,3,6,4\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = \[1,2,3,4,5\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,6,4,3,1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

Question ID: 123
Code Description: You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = \[1,2,3,4,5\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,6,4,3,1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

    Given an integer array `nums`, return _the **k** most frequent elements_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

The **frequency** of an element is the number of times it appears in the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,1,2,2,3\], k = 2
**Output:** \[1,2\]
**Explanation:** 
1 appears 3 times while 2 appears 2 times, both are the **k** most frequent elements.
Note that **ans** must contain each element at most once.

**Example 2:**

Question ID: 174
Code Description: The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in **the bottom-right corner** of a `dungeon`. The `dungeon` consists of `m x n` rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in **the top-left room** and must fight his way through `dungeon` to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to `0` or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only **rightward** or **downward** in each step.

Return _the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess_.

**Note** that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dungeon = \[\[-2,-3,3\],\[-5,-10,1\],\[10,30,-5\]\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** The initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path: RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** dungeon = \[\[0\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `m == dungeon.length`
*   `n == dungeon[i].length`

Code Description: We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:

1.  I pick a number between `1` and `n`.
2.  You guess a number.
3.  If you guess the right number, **you win the game**.
4.  If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is **higher or lower**, and you will continue guessing.
5.  Every time you guess a wrong number `x`, you will pay `x` dollars. If you run out of money, **you lose the game**.

Given a particular `n`, return _the minimum amount of money you need to **guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 10
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:** The winning strategy is as follows:
- The range is \[1,10\]. Guess 7.
    - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $7.
    - If my number is higher, the range is \[8,10\]. Guess 9.
        - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $9.
        - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
        - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
    - If my number is lower, the range is \[1,6\]. Guess 3.
        - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.
        - If my number is higher, the range is \[4,6\]. Guess 5.
            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.
            - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
            - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
        - If my number is lower, the range is \[1,2\]. Guess 1.
            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.
            - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.
The worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There is only one possible number, so you can guess 1 and not have to pay anything.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Explanation:** There are two possible numbers, 1 and 2.
- Guess 1.
    - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $1.
    - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $1.
The worst case is that you pay $1.

Question ID: 376
Code Description: A **wiggle sequence** is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

*   For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a **wiggle sequence** because the differences `(6, -3, 5, -7, 3)` alternate between positive and negative.
*   In contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

A **subsequence** is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the length of the longest **wiggle subsequence** of_ `nums`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,7,4,9,2,5\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
One is \[1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8\] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\]
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

**Follow up:** Could you solve this in `O(n)` time?

Code Description: Given an array of **distinct** integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, return _the number of possible combinations that add up to_ `target`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

    # Problem Description3
    Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`, return _the number of **unique** subsets in the array which have sum equal to_ `target`.

The **subsets** with the same value are unique, that is:

*   If the subset `[1,2,2,4]` has the same value as the subset `[1,2,3,4]`, then the two subsets are unique, and we only need to count one of them.
*   If two subsets have different values, then they are unique, such as the subset `[1,2,2,4]` is unique since it doesn't have the value `1` and `2` in the same subset.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\], target = 4
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** The **subsets** with target 4 are:
\[1,1,1,1\]
\[1,1,2\]
\[1,2,1\]
\[1,3\]
\[2,1,1\]
\[2,2\]

Code Description: Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `s` _is a **subsequence** of_ `t`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace "` is a subsequence of `"abcde "` while `"aec "` is not).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= t.length <= 104`
*   `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

Question ID: 396
Code Description: You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

Assume `arrk` to be an array obtained by rotating `nums` by `k` positions clock-wise. We define the **rotation function** `F` on `nums` as follow:

*   `F(k) = 0 * arrk[0] + 1 * arrk[1] + ... + (n - 1) * arrk[n - 1].`

Return _the maximum value of_ `F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1)`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,3,2,6\]
**Output:** 26
**Explanation:**
F(0) = (0 \* 4) + (1 \* 3) + (2 \* 2) + (3 \* 6) = 0 + 3 + 4 + 18 = 25
F(1) = (0 \* 6) + (1 \* 4) + (2 \* 3) + (3 \* 2) = 0 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
F(2) = (0 \* 2) + (1 \* 6) + (2 \* 4) + (3 \* 3) = 0 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 23
F(3) = (0 \* 3) + (1 \* 2) + (2 \* 6) + (3 \* 4) = 0 + 2 + 12 + 12 = 26
So the maximum value of F(0), F(1), F(2), F(3) is F(3) = 26.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[100\]

Code Description: A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of `stones`' positions (in units) in sorted **ascending order**, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be `1` unit.

If the frog's last jump was `k` units, its next jump must be either `k - 1`, `k`, or `k + 1` units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stones = \[0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** stones = \[0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11\]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the number of arithmetic **subarrays** of_ `nums`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: \[1, 2, 3\], \[2, 3, 4\] and \[1,2,3,4\] itself.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1\]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
*   `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

    # Problem Description3
    Given an integer array `nums`, return _the **k** most frequent elements_ **.** The answer should be sorted by **frequency** from highest to lowest. If two numbers have the same frequency, then the number with a smaller index should come first.

    **Example 1:**

    **Input:** nums = \[1,1,1,2,2,3\], k = 2
    **Output:** \[1,2\]
    Explanation:
    "1" and "2" are the two most frequent numbers, with a frequency of 2 each.
    "1" comes before "2" due to a lower index.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = \[\[1,2\],\[2,3\],\[3,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** \[1,3\] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = \[\[1,2\],\[1,2\],\[1,2\]\]

Question ID: 446
Code Description: Given an integer array `nums`, return _the number of all the **arithmetic subsequences** of_ `nums`.

A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of **at least three elements** and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

*   For example, `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, `[7, 7, 7, 7]`, and `[3, -1, -5, -9]` are arithmetic sequences.
*   For example, `[1, 1, 2, 5, 7]` is not an arithmetic sequence.

A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.

*   For example, `[2,5,10]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,1,**2**,4,1,**5**,**10**]`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,4,6,8,10\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
\[2,4,6\]
\[4,6,8\]
\[6,8,10\]
\[2,4,6,8\]
\[4,6,8,10\]
\[2,4,6,8,10\]
\[2,6,10\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[7,7,7,7,7\]
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:** Any subsequence of this array is arithmetic.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`

Question ID: 458
Code Description: There are `buckets` buckets of liquid, where **exactly one** of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have `minutesToTest` minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.

You can feed the pigs according to these steps:

1.  Choose some live pigs to feed.
2.  For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs.
3.  Wait for `minutesToDie` minutes. You may **not** feed any other pigs during this time.
4.  After `minutesToDie` minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.
5.  Repeat this process until you run out of time.

Given `buckets`, `minutesToDie`, and `minutesToTest`, return _the **minimum** number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 15
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:
At time 0, feed the first pig buckets 1 and 2, and feed the second pig buckets 2 and 3.
At time 15, there are 4 possible outcomes:
- If only the first pig dies, then bucket 1 must be poisonous.
- If only the second pig dies, then bucket 3 must be poisonous.
- If both pigs die, then bucket 2 must be poisonous.
- If neither pig dies, then bucket 4 must be poisonous.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 30
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:
At time 0, feed the first pig bucket 1, and feed the second pig bucket 2.
At time 15, there are 2 possible outcomes:
- If either pig dies, then the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.
- If neither pig dies, then feed the first pig bucket 3, and feed the second pig bucket 4.
At time 30, one of the two pigs must die, and the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= buckets <= 1000`
*   `1 <= minutesToDie <= minutesToTest <= 100`
Generated Code:
:
- If only the first pig dies, then bucket 1 must be poisonous.
- If both pigs die, then bucket 2 must be poisonous.

At time 30, there are 4 possible outcomes:
- If only the first pig dies, then bucket 1 must be poisonous.
- If only the second pig dies, then bucket 2 must be poisonous.
- If both pigs die, then bucket 3 must be poisonous.
- If neither pig dies, then bucket 4 must be poisonous.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 60
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We can determine the poisonous bucket within 60 minutes.
At time 0, feed the first pig bucket 1, and feed the second pig bucket 2.
At time 15, feed the third pig bucket 3.
At time 30, feed the fourth pig bucket 4.
At time 45, there are 4 possible outcomes:
- If only the first pig dies, then bucket 1 must be poisonous.
- If only the second pig dies, then bucket 2 must be poisonous.
- If only the third pig dies, then bucket 3 must be poisonous.
- If only the fourth pig dies, then bucket 4 must be poisonous.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** buckets = 1000, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 60
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can determine the poisonous bucket within 60 minutes.
At time 0, feed the first pig bucket 1, and feed the second pig bucket 2.
At time 15, feed the third pig bucket 3.
At time 30, feed the fourth pig bucket 4.
At time 45, feed the fifth pig bucket 5.
At time 60, feed the sixth pig bucket 6.
At time 75, feed the seventh pig bucket 7.
At time 90

Question ID: 464
Code Description: In the "100 game " two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from `1` to `10`. The player who first causes the running total to **reach or exceed** 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players **cannot** re-use integers?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given two integers `maxChoosableInteger` and `desiredTotal`, return `true` if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return `false`. Assume both players play **optimally**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 0
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 1
**Output:** true

Code Description: You are given an array of binary strings `strs` and two integers `m` and `n`.

Return _the size of the largest subset of `strs` such that there are **at most**_ `m` `0`_'s and_ `n` `1`_'s in the subset_.

A set `x` is a **subset** of a set `y` if all elements of `x` are also elements of `y`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = \[ "10 ", "0001 ", "111001 ", "1 ", "0 "\], m = 5, n = 3
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is { "10 ",  "0001 ",  "1 ",  "0 "}, so the answer is 4.
Other valid but smaller subsets include { "0001 ",  "1 "} and { "10 ",  "1 ",  "0 "}.
{ "111001 "} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = \[ "10 ", "0 ", "1 "\], m = 1, n = 1
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The largest subset is { "0 ",  "1 "}, so the answer is 2.

Question ID: 486
Code Description: You are given an integer array `nums`. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of `0`. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1]`) which reduces the size of the array by `1`. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return `true` if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return `true`. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,5,2\]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,5,233,7\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 107`

Question ID: 488
Code Description: You are playing a variation of the game Zuma.

In this variation of Zuma, there is a **single row** of colored balls on a board, where each ball can be colored red `'R'`, yellow `'Y'`, blue `'B'`, green `'G'`, or white `'W'`. You also have several colored balls in your hand.

Your goal is to **clear all** of the balls from the board. On each turn:

*   Pick **any** ball from your hand and insert it in between two balls in the row or on either end of the row.
*   If there is a group of **three or more consecutive balls** of the **same color**, remove the group of balls from the board.
    *   If this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left.
*   If there are no more balls on the board, then you win the game.
*   Repeat this process until you either win or do not have any more balls in your hand.

Given a string `board`, representing the row of balls on the board, and a string `hand`, representing the balls in your hand, return _the **minimum** number of balls you have to insert to clear all the balls from the board. If you cannot clear all the balls from the board using the balls in your hand, return_ `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board =  "WRRBBW ", hand =  "RB "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** It is impossible to clear all the balls. The best you can do is:
- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WRRRBBW. WRRRBBW -> WBBW.
- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WBBBW. WBBBW -> WW.
There are still balls remaining on the board, and you are out of balls to insert.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board =  "WWRRBBWW ", hand =  "WRBRW "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** To make the board empty:
- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WWRRRBBWW. WWRRRBBWW -> WWBBWW.
- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WWBBBWW. WWBBBWW -> WWWW -> empty.
2 balls from your hand were needed to clear the board.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** board =  "G ", hand =  "GGGGG "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** To make the board empty:
- Insert 'G' so the board becomes GG.
- Insert 'G' so the board becomes GGG. GGG -> empty.
2 balls from your hand were needed to clear the board.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= board.length <= 16`
*   `1 <= hand.length <= 5`
*   `board` and `hand` consist of the characters `'R'`, `'Y'`, `'B'`, `'G'`, and `'W'`.
*   The initial row of balls on the board will **not** have any groups of three or more consecutive balls of the same color.

3 balls from your hand were needed to clear the board.

**Example 5:**

**Input:** board =  "RBYBYYRBYY", hand =  "YRBGB "

Given a string `ring` that represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string `key` that represents the keyword that needs to be spelled, return _the minimum number of steps to spell all the characters in the keyword_.

Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at the `"12:00 "` direction. You should spell all the characters in `key` one by one by rotating `ring` clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at the `"12:00 "` direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character `key[i]`:

1.  You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as **one step**. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of `ring`'s characters at the `"12:00 "` direction, where this character must equal `key[i]`.
2.  If the character `key[i]` has been aligned at the `"12:00 "` direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as **one step**. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ring =  "godding ", key =  "gd "
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:**
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. 
For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring  "godding " anticlockwise by two steps to make it become  "ddinggo ".
Also, we need 1 more step for spelling.
So the final output is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ring =  "godding ", key =  "godding "
**Output:** 13

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= ring.length, key.length <= 100`
*   `ring` and `key` consist of only lower case English letters.
*   It is guaranteed that `key` could always be spelled by rotating `ring`.
Generated Code:
by rotating `ring`.

Code Description: An attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

*   `'A'`: Absent.
*   `'L'`: Late.
*   `'P'`: Present.

Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet **both** of the following criteria:

*   The student was absent (`'A'`) for **strictly** fewer than 2 days **total**.
*   The student was **never** late (`'L'`) for 3 or more **consecutive** days.

Given an integer `n`, return _the **number** of possible attendance records of length_ `n` _that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it **modulo**_ `109 + 7`.

Code Description: You are given an integer array `nums`. The adjacent integers in `nums` will perform the float division.

*   For example, for `nums = [2,3,4]`, we will evaluate the expression `"2/3/4 "`.

However, you can add any number of parenthesis at any position to change the priority of operations. You want to add these parentheses such the value of the expression after the evaluation is maximum.

Return _the corresponding expression that has the maximum value in string format_.

**Note:** your expression should not contain redundant parenthesis.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1000,100,10,2\]
**Output:**  "1000/(100/10/2) "
**Explanation:** 1000/(100/10/2) = 1000/((100/10)/2) = 200
However, the bold parenthesis in  "1000/(**(**100/10**)**/2) " are redundant since they do not influence the operation priority.
So you should return  "1000/(100/10/2) ".
Other cases:
1000/(100/10)/2 = 50
1000/(100/(10/2)) = 50
1000/100/10/2 = 0.5
1000/100/(10/2) = 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,4\]
**Output:**  "2/(3/4) "
**Explanation:** (2/(3/4)) = 8/3 = 2.667
It can be shown that after trying all possibilities, we cannot get an expression with evaluation greater than 2.667

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 10`
*   `2 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   There is only one optimal division for the given input.

Code Description: There is an `m x n` grid with a ball. The ball is initially at the position `[startRow, startColumn]`. You are allowed to move the ball to one of the four adjacent cells in the grid (possibly out of the grid crossing the grid boundary). You can apply **at most** `maxMove` moves to the ball.

Given the five integers `m`, `n`, `maxMove`, `startRow`, `startColumn`, return the number of paths to move the ball out of the grid boundary. Since the answer can be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 2, n = 2, maxMove = 2, startRow = 0, startColumn = 0

Question ID: 638
Code Description: In LeetCode Store, there are `n` items to sell. Each item has a price. However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more different kinds of items with a sale price.

You are given an integer array `price` where `price[i]` is the price of the `ith` item, and an integer array `needs` where `needs[i]` is the number of pieces of the `ith` item you want to buy.

You are also given an array `special` where `special[i]` is of size `n + 1` where `special[i][j]` is the number of pieces of the `jth` item in the `ith` offer and `special[i][n]` (i.e., the last integer in the array) is the price of the `ith` offer.

Return _the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers_. You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price. You could use any of the special offers as many times as you want.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** price = \[2,5\], special = \[\[3,0,5\],\[1,2,10\]\], needs = \[3,2\]
**Output:** 14
**Explanation:** There are two kinds of items, A and B. Their prices are $2 and $5 respectively. 
In special offer 1, you can pay $5 for 3A and 0B
In special offer 2, you can pay $10 for 1A and 2B. 
You need to buy 3A and 2B, so you may pay $10 for 1A and 2B (special offer #2), and $4 for 2A.

Question ID: 639
Code Description: A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' ->  "1 "
'B' ->  "2 "
...
'Z' ->  "26 "

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11106 "` can be mapped into:

*   `"AAJF "` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
*   `"KJF "` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`

Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06 "` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6 "` is different from `"06 "`.

**In addition** to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the `'*'` character, which can represent any digit from `'1'` to `'9'` (`'0'` is excluded). For example, the encoded message `"1* "` may represent any of the encoded messages `"11 "`, `"12 "`, `"13 "`, `"14 "`, `"15 "`, `"16 "`, `"17 "`, `"18 "`, or `"19 "`. Decoding `"1* "` is equivalent to decoding **any** of the encoded messages it can represent.

Given a string `s` consisting of digits and `'*'` characters, return _the **number** of ways to **decode** it_.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "\* "
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages  "1 ",  "2 ",  "3 ",  "4 ",  "5 ",  "6 ",  "7 ",  "8 ", or  "9 ".
Each of these can be decoded to the strings  "A ",  "B ",  "C ",  "D ",  "E ",  "F ",  "G ",  "H ", and  "I " respectively.
Hence, there are a total of 9 ways to decode  "\* ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "1\* "
**Output:** 18
**Explanation:** The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages  "11 ",  "12 ",  "13 ",  "14 ",  "15 ",  "16 ",  "17 ",  "18 ", or  "19 ".
Each of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e.g.  "11 " can be decoded to  "AA " or  "K ").
Hence, there are a total of 9 \* 2 = 18 ways to decode  "1\* ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "2\* "
**Output:** 15
**Explanation:** The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages  "21 ",  "22 ",  "23 ",  "24 ",  "25 ",  "26 ",  "27 ",  "28 ", or  "29 ".
 "21 ",  "22 ",  "23 ",  "24 ",  "25 ", and  "26 " have 2 ways of being decoded, but  "27 ",  "28 ", and  "29 " only have 1 way.
Hence, there are a total of (6 \* 2) + (3 \* 1) = 12 + 3 = 15 ways to decode  "2\* ".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
*   `s[i]` is a digit or `'*'`.
Generated Code:
"11 ", "12 ", "13 ", "14 ", "15 ", "16 ", "17 ", "18 ", or "19 ".
Each of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e.g., "11 " can be decoded to "AA" or "K" ), resulting in 9 * 2 = 18 ways.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "2\*6"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The encoded message "2\*6" can be decoded to "BZ" with 1 way, or it can be decoded to "VF" with 2 ways.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s =  "2\*2\*6"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The encoded message "2\*2\*6" can be decoded to "BBCFF" with 1 way, or it can be decoded to "VVZ" with 3 ways.

**Example 5:**

**Input:** s =  "*\*1"
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages "A*1 ", "B*1 ", "C*1 ", "D*1 ", "E*1 ", "F*1 ", "G*1 ", "H*1 ", or "I*1 ".
These 9 encoded messages have 2 ways each to be decoded (e.g., "A\*1 " can be decoded to "JD" with 2 ways), resulting in 9 \* 2 = 18 ways.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`

Code Description: On an `n x n` chessboard, a knight starts at the cell `(row, column)` and attempts to make exactly `k` moves. The rows and columns are **0-indexed**, so the top-left cell is `(0, 0)`, and the bottom-right cell is `(n - 1, n - 1)`.

A chess knight has eight possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.

Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.

The knight continues moving until it has made exactly `k` moves or has moved off the chessboard.

Return _the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 2, row = 0, column = 0
**Output:** 0.06250
**Explanation:** There are two moves (to (1,2), (2,1)) that will keep the knight on the board.
From each of those positions, there are also two moves that will keep the knight on the board.
The total probability the knight stays on the board is 0.0625.

**Input:** n = 1, k = 0, row = 0, column = 0

Question ID: 691
Code Description: We are given `n` different types of `stickers`. Each sticker has a lowercase English word on it.

You would like to spell out the given string `target` by cutting individual letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them. You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite quantities of each sticker.

Return _the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out_ `target`. If the task is impossible, return `-1`.

**Note:** In all test cases, all words were chosen randomly from the `1000` most common US English words, and `target` was chosen as a concatenation of two random words.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stickers = \[ "with ", "example ", "science "\], target =  "thehat "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
We can use 2  "with " stickers, and 1  "example " sticker.
After cutting and rearrange the letters of those stickers, we can form the target  "thehat ".
Also, this is the minimum number of stickers necessary to form the target string.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** stickers = \[ "notice ", "possible "\], target =  "basicbasic "
**Output:** -1
Explanation:
We cannot form the target  "basicbasic " from cutting letters from the given stickers.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == stickers.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 50`
*   `1 <= stickers[i].length <= 10`
*   `1 <= target.length <= 15`

Question ID: 712
Code Description: Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return _the lowest **ASCII** sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "sea ", s2 =  "eat "
**Output:** 231
**Explanation:** Deleting  "s " from  "sea " adds the ASCII value of  "s " (115) to the sum.
Deleting  "t " from  "eat " adds 116 to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "delete ", s2 =  "leet "
**Output:** 403
**Explanation:** Deleting  "dee " from  "delete " to turn the string into  "let ",
adds 100\[d\] + 101\[e\] + 101\[e\] to the sum.
Deleting  "e " from  "leet " adds 101\[e\] to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal to  "let ", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.
If instead we turned both strings into  "lee " or  "eet ", we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.

Code Description: You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

Question ID: 741
Code Description: You are given an `n x n` `grid` representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.

*   `0` means the cell is empty, so you can pass through,
*   `1` means the cell contains a cherry that you can pick up and pass through, or
*   `-1` means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.

Return _the maximum number of cherries you can collect by following the rules below_:

*   Starting at the position `(0, 0)` and reaching `(n - 1, n - 1)` by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value `0` or `1`).
*   After reaching `(n - 1, n - 1)`, returning to `(0, 0)` by moving left or up through valid path cells.
*   When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up, and the cell becomes an empty cell `0`.
*   If there is no valid path between `(0, 0)` and `(n - 1, n - 1)`, then no cherries can be collected.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[0,1,-1\],\[1,0,-1\],\[1,1,1\]\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right right to reach (2, 2).
4 cherries were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix becomes \[\[0,1,-1\],\[0,0,-1\],\[0,0,0\]\].
Then, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up one more cherry.
The total number of cherries picked up is 5, and this is the maximum possible.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,1,-1\],\[1,-1,1\],\[-1,1,1\]\]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `n == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= n <= 50`
*   `grid[i][j]` is `-1`, `0`, or `1`.
*   `grid[0][0] != -1`
*   `grid[n - 1][n - 1] != -1`

Question ID: 764
Code Description: You are given an integer `n`. You have an `n x n` binary grid `grid` with all values initially `1`'s except for some indices given in the array `mines`. The `ith` element of the array `mines` is defined as `mines[i] = [xi, yi]` where `grid[xi][yi] == 0`.

Return _the order of the largest **axis-aligned** plus sign of_ 1_'s contained in_ `grid`. If there is none, return `0`.

An **axis-aligned plus sign** of `1`'s of order `k` has some center `grid[r][c] == 1` along with four arms of length `k - 1` going up, down, left, and right, and made of `1`'s. Note that there could be `0`'s or `1`'s beyond the arms of the plus sign, only the relevant area of the plus sign is checked for `1`'s.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, mines = \[\[4,2\]\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** In the above grid, the largest plus sign can only be of order 2. One of them is shown.

**Example 2:**

Question ID: 799
Code Description: We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the **first** row has `1` glass, the **second** row has `2` glasses, and so on until the 100th row. Each glass holds one cup of champagne.

Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top. When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it. When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on. (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.)

For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full. After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full. After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now. After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.

Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the `jth` glass in the `ith` row is (both `i` and `j` are 0-indexed.)

**Example 1:**

**Input:** poured = 1, query\_row = 1, query\_glass = 1
**Output:** 0.00000
**Explanation:** We poured 1 cup of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There will be no excess liquid so all the glasses under the top glass will remain empty.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** poured = 2, query\_row = 1, query\_glass = 1
**Output:** 0.50000
**Explanation:** We poured 2 cups of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There is one cup of excess liquid. The glass indexed as (1, 0) and the glass indexed as (1, 1) will share the excess liquid equally, and each will get half cup of champange.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** poured = 100000009, query\_row = 33, query\_glass = 17
**Output:** 1.00000

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= poured <= 109`

    # Problem Description3
    Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`, return _the indices of the_ _two numbers_ _such that they add up to_ `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
**Output:** [0,1]
**Output:** Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
**Output:** [1,2]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [3,3], target = 6
**Output:** [0,1]

Question ID: 801
Code Description: You are given two integer arrays of the same length `nums1` and `nums2`. In one operation, you are allowed to swap `nums1[i]` with `nums2[i]`.

*   For example, if `nums1 = [1,2,3,8]`, and `nums2 = [5,6,7,4]`, you can swap the element at `i = 3` to obtain `nums1 = [1,2,3,4]` and `nums2 = [5,6,7,8]`.

Return _the minimum number of needed operations to make_ `nums1` _and_ `nums2` _**strictly increasing**_. The test cases are generated so that the given input always makes it possible.

An array `arr` is **strictly increasing** if and only if `arr[0] < arr[1] < arr[2] < ... < arr[arr.length - 1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,3,5,4\], nums2 = \[1,2,3,7\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** 
Swap nums1\[3\] and nums2\[3\]. Then the sequences are:
nums1 = \[1, 3, 5, 7\] and nums2 = \[1, 2, 3, 4\]
which are both strictly increasing.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[0,3,5,8,9\], nums2 = \[2,1,4,6,9\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums1.length <= 105`
*   `nums2.length == nums1.length`
*   `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 2 * 105`

Question ID: 808
Code Description: There are two types of soup: **type A** and **type B**. Initially, we have `n` ml of each type of soup. There are four kinds of operations:

1.  Serve `100` ml of **soup A** and `0` ml of **soup B**,
2.  Serve `75` ml of **soup A** and `25` ml of **soup B**,
3.  Serve `50` ml of **soup A** and `50` ml of **soup B**, and
4.  Serve `25` ml of **soup A** and `75` ml of **soup B**.

When we serve some soup, we give it to someone, and we no longer have it. Each turn, we will choose from the four operations with an equal probability `0.25`. If the remaining volume of soup is not enough to complete the operation, we will serve as much as possible. We stop once we no longer have some quantity of both types of soup.

**Note** that we do not have an operation where all `100` ml's of **soup B** are used first.

Return _the probability that **soup A** will be empty first, plus half the probability that **A** and **B** become empty at the same time_. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 50
**Output:** 0.62500
**Explanation:** If we choose the first two operations, A will become empty first.
For the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time.
For the fourth operation, B will become empty first.
So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 \* (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 100

Question ID: 813
Code Description: You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You can partition the array into **at most** `k` non-empty adjacent subarrays. The **score** of a partition is the sum of the averages of each subarray.

Note that the partition must use every integer in `nums`, and that the score is not necessarily an integer.

Return _the maximum **score** you can achieve of all the possible partitions_. Answers within `10-6` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[9,1,2,3,9\], k = 3
**Output:** 20.00000
**Explanation:** 
The best choice is to partition nums into \[9\], \[1, 2, 3\], \[9\]. The answer is 9 + (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 + 9 = 20.
We could have also partitioned nums into \[9, 1\], \[2\], \[3, 9\], for example.
That partition would lead to a score of 5 + 2 + 6 = 13, which is worse.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7\], k = 4
**Output:** 20.50000

Question ID: 828
Code Description: Let's define a function `countUniqueChars(s)` that returns the number of unique characters on `s`.

*   For example, calling `countUniqueChars(s)` if `s = "LEETCODE "` then `"L "`, `"T "`, `"C "`, `"O "`, `"D "` are the unique characters since they appear only once in `s`, therefore `countUniqueChars(s) = 5`.

Given a string `s`, return the sum of `countUniqueChars(t)` where `t` is a substring of `s`. The test cases are generated such that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

Notice that some substrings can be repeated so in this case you have to count the repeated ones too.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "ABC "
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** All possible substrings are:  "A ", "B ", "C ", "AB ", "BC " and  "ABC ".
Every substring is composed with only unique letters.
Sum of lengths of all substring is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "ABA "
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** The same as example 1, except `countUniqueChars`( "ABA ") = 1.

Question ID: 838
Code Description: There are `n` dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright. In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.

After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.

When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.

For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.

You are given a string `dominoes` representing the initial state where:

*   `dominoes[i] = 'L'`, if the `ith` domino has been pushed to the left,
*   `dominoes[i] = 'R'`, if the `ith` domino has been pushed to the right, and
*   `dominoes[i] = '.'`, if the `ith` domino has not been pushed.

Return _a string representing the final state_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dominoes =  "RR.L "
**Output:**  "RR.L "
**Explanation:** The first domino expends no additional force on the second domino.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** dominoes =  ".L.R...LR..L.. "
**Output:**  "LL.RR.LLRRLL.. "

**Constraints:**

*   `n == dominoes.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `dominoes[i]` is either `'L'`, `'R'`, or `'.'`.

Question ID: 871
Code Description: A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is `target` miles east of the starting position.

There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array `stations` where `stations[i] = [positioni, fueli]` indicates that the `ith` gas station is `positioni` miles east of the starting position and has `fueli` liters of gas.

The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has `startFuel` liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.

Return _the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination_. If it cannot reach the destination, return `-1`.

Note that if the car reaches a gas station with `0` fuel left, the car can still refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with `0` fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = \[\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** We can reach the target without refueling.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = \[\[10,100\]\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** We can not reach the target (or even the first gas station).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = \[\[10,60\],\[20,30\],\[30,30\],\[60,40\]\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We start with 10 liters of fuel.
We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0 liters to 60 liters of gas.
Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),
and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas.  We then drive to and reach the target.
We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= target, startFuel <= 109`

Code Description: Alice and Bob play a game with piles of stones. There are an **even** number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a **positive** integer number of stones `piles[i]`.

The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. The **total** number of stones across all the piles is **odd**, so there are no ties.

Alice and Bob take turns, with **Alice starting first**. Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones either from the **beginning** or from the **end** of the row. This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the **most stones wins**.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return `true` _if Alice wins the game, or_ `false` _if Bob wins_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** piles = \[5,3,4,5\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
Alice starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.
Say she takes the first 5, so that the row becomes \[3, 4, 5\].
If Bob takes 3, then the board is \[4, 5\], and Alice takes 5 to win with 10 points.
If Bob takes the last 5, then the board is \[3, 4\], and Alice takes 4 to win with 9 points.
This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alice, so we return true.

**Input:** piles = \[3,7,2,3\]
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= piles.length <= 500`
*   `piles.length` is **even**.

Code Description: You are given `k` identical eggs and you have access to a building with `n` floors labeled from `1` to `n`.

You know that there exists a floor `f` where `0 <= f <= n` such that any egg dropped at a floor **higher** than `f` will **break**, and any egg dropped **at or below** floor `f` will **not break**.

Each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor `x` (where `1 <= x <= n`). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may **reuse** it in future moves.

Return _the **minimum number of moves** that you need to determine **with certainty** what the value of_ `f` is.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 1, n = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 
Drop the egg from floor 1. If it breaks, we know that f = 0.
Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2. If it breaks, we know that f = 1.
If it does not break, then we know f = 2.
Hence, we need at minimum 2 moves to determine with certainty what the value of f is.

Question ID: 913
Code Description: A game on an **undirected** graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[a]` is a list of all nodes `b` such that `ab` is an edge of the graph.

The mouse starts at node `1` and goes first, the cat starts at node `2` and goes second, and there is a hole at node `0`.

During each player's turn, they **must** travel along one edge of the graph that meets where they are. For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it **must** travel to any node in `graph[1]`.

Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0.)

Then, the game can end in three ways:

*   If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.
*   If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.
*   If ever a position is repeated (i.e., the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw.

Given a `graph`, and assuming both players play optimally, return

*   `1` if the mouse wins the game,
*   `2` if the cat wins the game, or
*   `0` if the game is a draw.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[2,5\],\[3\],\[0,4,5\],\[1,4,5\],\[2,3\],\[0,2,3\]\]
**Output:** 0

**Example 2:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,3\],\[0\],\[3\],\[0,2\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `3 <= graph.length <= 50`
*   `1 <= graph[i].length < graph.length`
*   `0 <= graph[i][j] < graph.length`
*   `graph[i][j] != i`

Code Description: Your music player contains `n` different songs. You want to listen to `goal` songs (not necessarily different) during your trip. To avoid boredom, you will create a playlist so that:

*   Every song is played **at least once**.
*   A song can only be played again only if `k` other songs have been played.

Given `n`, `goal`, and `k`, return _the number of possible playlists that you can create_. Since the answer can be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, goal = 3, k = 1

Code Description: The chess knight has a **unique movement**, it may move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of an **L**). The possible movements of chess knight are shown in this diagaram:

A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

We have a chess knight and a phone pad as shown below, the knight **can only stand on a numeric cell** (i.e. blue cell).

Given an integer `n`, return how many distinct phone numbers of length `n` we can dial.

You are allowed to place the knight **on any numeric cell** initially and then you should perform `n - 1` jumps to dial a number of length `n`. All jumps should be **valid** knight jumps.

As the answer may be very large, **return the answer modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** We need to dial a number of length 1, so placing the knight over any numeric cell of the 10 cells is sufficient.

Question ID: 960
Code Description: You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length.

We may choose any deletion indices, and we delete all the characters in those indices for each string.

For example, if we have `strs = [ "abcdef ", "uvwxyz "]` and deletion indices `{0, 2, 3}`, then the final array after deletions is `[ "bef ", "vyz "]`.

Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices `answer` such that after deletions, the final array has **every string (row) in lexicographic** order. (i.e., `(strs[0][0] <= strs[0][1] <= ... <= strs[0][strs[0].length - 1])`, and `(strs[1][0] <= strs[1][1] <= ... <= strs[1][strs[1].length - 1])`, and so on). Return _the minimum possible value of_ `answer.length`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = \[ "babca ", "bbazb "\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After deleting columns 0, 1, and 4, the final array is strs = \[ "bc ",  "az "\].
Both these rows are individually in lexicographic order (ie. strs\[0\]\[0\] <= strs\[0\]\[1\] and strs\[1\]\[0\] <= strs\[1\]\[1\]).
Note that strs\[0\] > strs\[1\] - the array strs is not necessarily in lexicographic order.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = \[ "edcba "\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** If we delete less than 4 columns, the only row will not be lexicographically sorted.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** strs = \[ "ghi ", "def ", "abc "\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** All rows are already lexicographically sorted.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == strs.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 100`
*   `1 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
*   `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

Question ID: 964
Code Description: Given a single positive integer `x`, we will write an expression of the form `x (op1) x (op2) x (op3) x ...` where each operator `op1`, `op2`, etc. is either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/)`. For example, with `x = 3`, we might write `3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3` which is a value of 3.

When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:

*   The division operator (`/`) returns rational numbers.
*   There are no parentheses placed anywhere.
*   We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.
*   It is not allowed to use the unary negation operator (`-`). For example, "`x - x` " is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but "`-x + x` " is not because it uses negation.

We would like to write an expression with the least number of operators such that the expression equals the given `target`. Return the least number of operators used.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 3, target = 19
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** 3 \* 3 + 3 \* 3 + 3 / 3.
The expression contains 5 operations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = 5, target = 501
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** 5 \* 5 \* 5 \* 5 - 5 \* 5 \* 5 + 5 / 5.
The expression contains 8 operations.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** x = 100, target = 100000000
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 100 \* 100 \* 100 \* 100.
The expression contains 3 operations.

Question ID: 975
Code Description: You are given an integer array `arr`. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called **odd-numbered jumps**, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called **even-numbered jumps**. Note that the **jumps** are numbered, not the indices.

You may jump forward from index `i` to index `j` (with `i < j`) in the following way:

*   During **odd-numbered jumps** (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] <= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the **smallest** such index `j`.
*   During **even-numbered jumps** (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] >= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the **smallest** such index `j`.
*   It may be the case that for some index `i`, there are no legal jumps.

A starting index is **good** if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index `arr.length - 1`) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).

Return _the number of **good** starting indices_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[10,13,12,14,15\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 
From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr\[2\] is the smallest among arr\[1\], arr\[2\], arr\[3\], arr\[4\] that is greater or equal to arr\[0\]), then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.
From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.
In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of
jumps.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = \[2,3,1,1,4\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 
From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:
During our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr\[1\] is the smallest value in \[arr\[1\], arr\[2\], arr\[3\], arr\[4\]\] that is greater than or equal to arr\[0\].
During our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr\[2\] is the largest value in \[arr\[2\], arr\[3\], arr\[4\]\] that is less than or equal to arr\[1\]. arr\[3\] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3
During our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr\[3\] is the smallest value in \[arr\[3\], arr\[4\]\] that is greater than or equal to arr\[2\].
We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.
In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.
From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.
In total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some
number of jumps.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = \[5,1,3,4,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can reach the end from starting indices 1, 2, and 4.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= arr.length <= 2 * 104`
*   `0 <= arr[i] < 105`
Generated Code:
so we have reached the end.
From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.
In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3, 4, for which we can reach the end with some number of jumps.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = \[2,3,1,1,4\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 
We can make at least 3 good jumps, as shown.
From starting index i = 0, we make our 1st jump to i = 1 (since arr\[1\] is the smallest among arr\[1\], arr\[2\], arr\[3\], arr\[4\] that is greater or equal to arr\[0\]), then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we make our 1st jump to i = 3, and from i = 3, we make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.
From starting index i = 3, we make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.
In total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, 3, 4, for which we can reach the end with some number of jumps.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = \[6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 
The best strategy is to make all odd-numbered jumps, then all even-numbered jumps:
From starting index i = 0, we make our 1st jump to i = 1, then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 1, we make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr\[2\] is the smallest value such that arr\[2\] >= arr\[1\] and arr\[2\] is the largest among arr\[2\], arr\[3\], arr\[4\], arr\[5\] that is less than or equal to arr\[1\]), and from i = 2, we

Code Description: You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array `days`. Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.

Train tickets are sold in **three different ways**:

*   a **1-day** pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars,
*   a **7-day** pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars, and
*   a **30-day** pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

*   For example, if we get a **7-day** pass on day `2`, then we can travel for `7` days: `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, and `8`.

Return _the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days_.

Question ID: 1000
Code Description: There are `n` piles of `stones` arranged in a row. The `ith` pile has `stones[i]` stones.

A move consists of merging exactly `k` **consecutive** piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these `k` piles.

Return _the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile_. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stones = \[3,2,4,1\], k = 2
**Output:** 20
**Explanation:** We start with \[3, 2, 4, 1\].
We merge \[3, 2\] for a cost of 5, and we are left with \[5, 4, 1\].
We merge \[4, 1\] for a cost of 5, and we are left with \[5, 5\].
We merge \[5, 5\] for a cost of 10, and we are left with \[10\].
The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** stones = \[3,2,4,1\], k = 3
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** stones = \[3,5,1,2,6\], k = 3
**Output:** 25
**Explanation:** We start with \[3, 5, 1, 2, 6\].
We merge \[5, 1, 2\] for a cost of 8, and we are left with \[3, 8, 6\].
We merge \[3, 8, 6\] for a cost of 17, and we are left with \[17\].
The total cost was 25, and this is the minimum possible.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == stones.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 30`
*   `1 <= stones[i] <= 100`

Question ID: 1024
Code Description: You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted `time` seconds. These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varying lengths.

Each video clip is described by an array `clips` where `clips[i] = [starti, endi]` indicates that the ith clip started at `starti` and ended at `endi`.

We can cut these clips into segments freely.

*   For example, a clip `[0, 7]` can be cut into segments `[0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7]`.

Return _the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event_ `[0, time]`. If the task is impossible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** clips = \[\[0,2\],\[4,6\],\[8,10\],\[1,9\],\[1,5\],\[5,9\]\], time = 10
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We take the clips \[0,2\], \[8,10\], \[1,9\]; a total of 3 clips.
Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
We cut \[1,9\] into segments \[1,2\] + \[2,8\] + \[8,9\].
Now we have segments \[0,2\] + \[2,8\] + \[8,10\] which cover the sporting event \[0, 10\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** clips = \[\[0,1\],\[1,2\]\], time = 5
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** We cannot cover \[0,5\] with only \[0,1\] and \[1,2\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** clips = \[\[0,1\],\[6,8\],\[0,2\],\[5,6\],\[0,4\],\[0,3\],\[6,7\],\[1,3\],\[4,7\],\[1,4\],\[2,5\],\[2,6\],\[3,4\],\[4,5\],\[5,7\],\[6,9\]\], time = 9
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can take clips \[0,4\], \[4,7\], and \[6,9\].

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= clips.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= starti <= endi <= 100`
*   `1 <= time <= 100`

0 <= i < j < k < nums.length, and nums\[i\] & nums\[j\] & nums\[k\] != 0. (\`&\` represents the bitwise AND operation.)
Generated Code:
],\[6,9\]\], time = 9
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can take clips \[0,4\], \[4,7\], and \[6,9\].

**Example 4:**

**Input:** clips = \[\[0,4\],\[2,8\],\[5,15\]\], time = 17
**Output:** 2

**Example 5:**

**Input:** clips = \[\[0,1\],\[0,2\],\[1,3\],\[4,4\]\], time = 5
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** We can take all the clips and reconstruct the sporting event.

Note that a connecting line cannot intersect even at the endpoints (i.e., each number can only belong to one connecting line).

Return _the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,4,2\], nums2 = \[1,2,4\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.
We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from nums1\[1\] = 4 to nums2\[2\] = 4 will intersect the line from nums1\[2\]=2 to nums2\[1\]=2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[2,5,1,2,5\], nums2 = \[10,5,2,1,5,2\]
**Output:** 3

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,3,7,1,7,5\], nums2 = \[1,9,2,5,1\]
**Output:** 2

Question ID: 1039
Code Description: You have a convex `n`\-sided polygon where each vertex has an integer value. You are given an integer array `values` where `values[i]` is the value of the `ith` vertex (i.e., **clockwise order**).

You will **triangulate** the polygon into `n - 2` triangles. For each triangle, the value of that triangle is the product of the values of its vertices, and the total score of the triangulation is the sum of these values over all `n - 2` triangles in the triangulation.

Return _the smallest possible total score that you can achieve with some triangulation of the polygon_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** values = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The polygon is already triangulated, and the score of the only triangle is 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** values = \[3,7,4,5\]
**Output:** 144
**Explanation:** There are two triangulations, with possible scores: 3\*7\*5 + 4\*5\*7 = 245, or 3\*4\*5 + 3\*4\*7 = 144.
The minimum score is 144.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** values = \[1,3,1,4,1,5\]
**Output:** 13
**Explanation:** The minimum score triangulation has score 1\*1\*3 + 1\*1\*4 + 1\*1\*5 + 1\*1\*1 = 13.

Question ID: 1048
Code Description: You are given an array of `words` where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

`wordA` is a **predecessor** of `wordB` if and only if we can insert **exactly one** letter anywhere in `wordA` **without changing the order of the other characters** to make it equal to `wordB`.

*   For example, `"abc "` is a **predecessor** of `"abac "`, while `"cba "` is not a **predecessor** of `"bcad "`.

A **word chain** is a sequence of words `[word1, word2, ..., wordk]` with `k >= 1`, where `word1` is a **predecessor** of `word2`, `word2` is a **predecessor** of `word3`, and so on. A single word is trivially a **word chain** with `k == 1`.

Return _the **length** of the **longest possible word chain** with words chosen from the given list of_ `words`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = \[ "a ", "b ", "ba ", "bca ", "bda ", "bdca "\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation**: One of the longest word chains is \[ "a ", "ba ", "bda ", "bdca "\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = \[ "xbc ", "pcxbcf ", "xb ", "cxbc ", "pcxbc "\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** All the words can be put in a word chain \[ "xb ",  "xbc ",  "cxbc ",  "pcxbc ",  "pcxbcf "\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = \[ "abcd ", "dbqca "\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The trivial word chain \[ "abcd "\] is one of the longest word chains.
\[ "abcd ", "dbqca "\] is not a valid word chain because the ordering of the letters is changed.

Code Description: You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the `ith` stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:

*   If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed, and
*   If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y - x`.

At the end of the game, there is **at most one** stone left.

Return _the smallest possible weight of the left stone_. If there are no stones left, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stones = \[2,7,4,1,8,1\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:**
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to \[2,7,1,8,1\] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to \[2,1,1,1\] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array converts to \[1,1,1\] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array converts to \[1\], then that's the optimal value.

Question ID: 1105
Code Description: You are given an array `books` where `books[i] = [thicknessi, heighti]` indicates the thickness and height of the `ith` book. You are also given an integer `shelfWidth`.

We want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have a total width `shelfWidth`.

We choose some of the books to place on this shelf such that the sum of their thickness is less than or equal to `shelfWidth`, then build another level of the shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down. We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.

Note that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books.

*   For example, if we have an ordered list of `5` books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.

Return _the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** books = \[\[1,1\],\[2,3\],\[2,3\],\[1,1\],\[1,1\],\[1,1\],\[1,2\]\], shelfWidth = 4
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:**
The sum of the heights of the 3 shelves is 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
Notice that book number 2 does not have to be on the first shelf.

Question ID: 1130
Code Description: Given an array `arr` of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:

*   Each node has either `0` or `2` children;
*   The values of `arr` correspond to the values of each **leaf** in an in-order traversal of the tree.
*   The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree, respectively.

Among all possible binary trees considered, return _the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node_. It is guaranteed this sum fits into a **32-bit** integer.

A node is a **leaf** if and only if it has zero children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[6,2,4\]
**Output:** 32
**Explanation:** There are two possible trees shown.
The first has a non-leaf node sum 36, and the second has non-leaf node sum 32.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = \[4,11\]
**Output:** 44

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= arr.length <= 40`
*   `1 <= arr[i] <= 15`
*   It is guaranteed that the answer fits into a **32-bit** signed integer (i.e., it is less than 231).

Question ID: 1140
Code Description: Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are a number of piles **arranged in a row**, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`. The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. Initially, `M = 1`.

On each player's turn, that player can take **all the stones** in the **first** `X` remaining piles, where `1 <= X <= 2M`. Then, we set `M = max(M, X)`.

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** piles = \[2,7,9,4,4\]
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:**  If Alice takes one pile at the beginning, Bob takes two piles, then Alice takes 2 piles again. Alice can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alice takes two piles at the beginning, then Bob can take all three piles left. In this case, Alice get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since it's larger. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** piles = \[1,2,3,4,5,100\]
**Output:** 104

*   `1 <= piles.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= piles[i] <= 104`

Code Description: Given an array of integers, return the maximum sum for a **non-empty** subarray (contiguous elements) with at most one element deletion. In other words, you want to choose a subarray and optionally delete one element from it so that there is still at least one element left and the sum of the remaining elements is maximum possible.

Note that the subarray needs to be **non-empty** after deleting one element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[1,-2,0,3\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Because we can choose \[1, -2, 0, 3\] and drop -2, thus the subarray \[1, 0, 3\] becomes the maximum value.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = \[1,-2,-2,3\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We just choose \[3\] and it's the maximum sum.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = \[-1,-1,-1,-1\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** The final subarray needs to be non-empty. You can't choose \[-1\] and delete -1 from it, then get an empty subarray to make the sum equals to 0.

Code Description: Given an integer `n`, your task is to count how many strings of length `n` can be formed under the following rules:

*   Each character is a lower case vowel (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`)
*   Each vowel `'a'` may only be followed by an `'e'`.
*   Each vowel `'e'` may only be followed by an `'a'` or an `'i'`.
*   Each vowel `'i'` **may not** be followed by another `'i'`.
*   Each vowel `'o'` may only be followed by an `'i'` or a `'u'`.
*   Each vowel `'u'` may only be followed by an `'a'.`

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7.`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** All possible strings are:  "a ",  "e ",  "i " ,  "o " and  "u ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2

    Given an integer `n`, return the number of strings of length `n` that consist only of vowels (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`) and are lexicographically sorted.

    A string `s` is lexicographically sorted if `s[0] <= s[1] <= s[2] ... <= s[s.length - 1]`.

    **Example 1:**

    **Input:** n = 1

Question ID: 1223
Code Description: A die simulator generates a random number from `1` to `6` for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number `i` more than `rollMax[i]` (**1-indexed**) consecutive times.

Given an array of integers `rollMax` and an integer `n`, return _the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact_ `n` _rolls_. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2, rollMax = \[1,1,2,2,2,3\]
**Output:** 34
**Explanation:** There will be 2 rolls of die, if there are no constraints on the die, there are 6 \* 6 = 36 possible combinations. In this case, looking at rollMax array, the numbers 1 and 2 appear at most once consecutively, therefore sequences (1,1) and (2,2) cannot occur, so the final answer is 36-2 = 34.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2, rollMax = \[1,1,1,1,1,1\]
**Output:** 30

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 3, rollMax = \[1,1,1,2,2,3\]
**Output:** 181

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 5000`

Code Description: You are given a square `board` of characters. You can move on the board starting at the bottom right square marked with the character `'S'`.

You need to reach the top left square marked with the character `'E'`. The rest of the squares are labeled either with a numeric character `1, 2, ..., 9` or with an obstacle `'X'`. In one move you can go up, left or up-left (diagonally) only if there is no obstacle there.

Return a list of two integers: the first integer is the maximum sum of numeric characters you can collect, and the second is the number of such paths that you can take to get that maximum sum, **taken modulo `10^9 + 7`**.

In case there is no path, return `[0, 0]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \["E23","2X2","12S"\]
**Output:** \[7,1\]

**Example 2:**

Code Description: You have a keyboard layout as shown above in the **X-Y** plane, where each English uppercase letter is located at some coordinate.

*   For example, the letter `'A'` is located at coordinate `(0, 0)`, the letter `'B'` is located at coordinate `(0, 1)`, the letter `'P'` is located at coordinate `(2, 3)` and the letter `'Z'` is located at coordinate `(4, 1)`.

Given the string `word`, return _the minimum total **distance** to type such string using only two fingers_.

The **distance** between coordinates `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

**Note** that the initial positions of your two fingers are considered free so do not count towards your total distance, also your two fingers do not have to start at the first letter or the first two letters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word =  "CAKE "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Using two fingers, one optimal way to type  "CAKE " is: 
Finger 1 on letter 'C' -> cost = 0 
Finger 1 on letter 'A' -> cost = Distance from letter 'C' to letter 'A' = 2 
Finger 2 on letter 'K' -> cost = 0 
Finger 2 on letter 'E' -> cost = Distance from letter 'K' to letter 'E' = 1 
Total distance = 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word =  "HAPPY "

Code Description: Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `d`. In one step you can jump from index `i` to index:

*   `i + x` where: `i + x < arr.length` and `0 < x <= d`.
*   `i - x` where: `i - x >= 0` and `0 < x <= d`.

In addition, you can only jump from index `i` to index `j` if `arr[i] > arr[j]` and `arr[i] > arr[k]` for all indices `k` between `i` and `j` (More formally `min(i, j) < k < max(i, j)`).

You can choose any index of the array and start jumping. Return _the maximum number of indices_ you can visit.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[6,4,14,6,8,13,9,7,10,6,12\], d = 2

Code Description: Given `n` orders, each order consist in pickup and delivery services.

Count all valid pickup/delivery possible sequences such that delivery(i) is always after of pickup(i).

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Unique order (P1, D1), Delivery 1 always is after of Pickup 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** All possible orders: 
(P1,P2,D1,D2), (P1,P2,D2,D1), (P1,D1,P2,D2), (P2,P1,D1,D2), (P2,P1,D2,D1) and (P2,D2,P1,D1).
This is an invalid order (P1,D2,P2,D1) because Pickup 2 is after of Delivery 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** 90

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 500`

Given 2 integers n and start. Your task is return any permutation p of (0,1,2.....,2^n -1) such that : p\[0\] = start, p\[i\] and p\[i+1\] differ by only one bit for all 0 <= i < 2^n - 1.

    Given a string `s` and a dictionary of words `words` (without any duplicates), find all `start` and `end` indices of substrings in `s` that contain all the `words`.

For example, given:

    s = "when we skydive we fall behind"

Code Description: Given an array of integers `cost` and an integer `target`, return _the **maximum** integer you can paint under the following rules_:

*   The cost of painting a digit `(i + 1)` is given by `cost[i]` (**0-indexed**).
*   The total cost used must be equal to `target`.
*   The integer does not have `0` digits.

Since the answer may be very large, return it as a string. If there is no way to paint any integer given the condition, return `"0 "`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** cost = \[4,3,2,5,6,7,2,5,5\], target = 9
**Output:**  "7772 "
**Explanation:** The cost to paint the digit '7' is 2, and the digit '2' is 3. Then cost( "7772 ") = 2\*3+ 3\*1 = 9. You could also paint  "977 ", but  "7772 " is the largest number.
**Digit    cost**
  1  ->   4
  2  ->   3
  3  ->   2
  4  ->   5
  5  ->   6
  6  ->   7
  7  ->   2
  8  ->   5
  9  ->   5

**Example 2:**

**Input:** cost = \[7,6,5,5,5,6,8,7,8\], target = 12
**Output:**  "85 "
**Explanation:** The cost to paint the digit '8' is 7, and the digit '5' is 5. Then cost( "85 ") = 7 + 5 = 12.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** cost = \[2,4,6,2,4,6,4,4,4\], target = 5
**Output:**  "0 "

*   `cost[i][j]`: is the cost of paint the house `i` with the color `j + 1`.

Return _the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses in such a way that there are exactly_ `target` _neighborhoods_. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** houses = \[0,0,0,0,0\], cost = \[\[1,10\],\[10,1\],\[10,1\],\[1,10\],\[5,1\]\], m = 5, n = 2, target = 3
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** Paint houses of this way \[1,2,2,1,1\]
This array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, \[{1}, {2,2}, {1,1}\].
Cost of paint all houses (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5) = 9.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** houses = \[0,2,1,2,0\], cost = \[\[1,10\],\[10,1\],\[10,1\],\[1,10\],\[5,1\]\], m = 5, n = 2, target = 3
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** Some houses are already painted, Paint the houses of this way \[2,2,1,2,2\]
This array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, \[{2,2}, {1}, {2,2}\]. 
Cost of paint the first and last house (10 + 1) = 11.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** houses = \[3,1,2,3\], cost = \[\[1,1,1\],\[1,1,1\],\[1,1,1\],\[1,1,1\]\], m = 4, n = 3, target = 3
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** Houses are already painted with a total of 4 neighborhoods \[{3},{1},{2},{3}\] different of target = 3.

**Constraints:**

*   `m == houses.length == cost.length`
*   `n == cost[i].length`

Question ID: 1477
Code Description: You are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`.

You have to find **two non-overlapping sub-arrays** of `arr` each with a sum equal `target`. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is **minimum**.

Return _the minimum sum of the lengths_ of the two required sub-arrays, or return `-1` if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[3,2,2,4,3\], target = 3
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 (\[3\] and \[3\]). The sum of their lengths is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = \[7,3,4,7\], target = 7
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 (\[7\], \[3,4\] and \[7\]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = \[4,3,2,6,2,3,4\], target = 6
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= arr.length <= 105`

Code Description: You are given a tree with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in the form of a parent array `parent` where `parent[i]` is the parent of `ith` node. The root of the tree is node `0`. Find the `kth` ancestor of a given node.

The `kth` ancestor of a tree node is the `kth` node in the path from that node to the root node.

Implement the `TreeAncestor` class:

*   `TreeAncestor(int n, int[] parent)` Initializes the object with the number of nodes in the tree and the parent array.
*   `int getKthAncestor(int node, int k)` return the `kth` ancestor of the given node `node`. If there is no such ancestor, return `-1`.

\[null, 1, 0, -1\]

**Explanation**
TreeAncestor treeAncestor = new TreeAncestor(7, \[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2\]);
treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(3, 1); // returns 1 which is the parent of 3
treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(5, 2); // returns 0 which is the grandparent of 5
treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(6, 3); // returns -1 because there is no such ancestor

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= k <= n <= 5 * 104`
*   `parent.length == n`

Code Description: Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a _move_ consisting of removing **any** non-zero **square number** of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`, return `true` if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return `false`, assuming both players play optimally.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2

Code Description: You are given a string `s`.

A split is called **good** if you can split `s` into two non-empty strings `sleft` and `sright` where their concatenation is equal to `s` (i.e., `sleft + sright = s`) and the number of distinct letters in `sleft` and `sright` is the same.

Return _the number of **good splits** you can make in `s`_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "aacaba "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There are 5 ways to split ` "aacaba "` and 2 of them are good. 
( "a ",  "acaba ") Left string and right string contains 1 and 3 different letters respectively.
( "aa ",  "caba ") Left string and right string contains 1 and 3 different letters respectively.
( "aac ",  "aba ") Left string and right string contains 2 and 2 different letters respectively (good split).
( "aaca ",  "ba ") Left string and right string contains 2 and 2 different letters respectively (good split).
( "aacab ",  "a ") Left string and right string contains 3 and 1 different letters respectively.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "abcd "
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Split the string as follows ( "ab ",  "cd ").

Question ID: 1531
Code Description: [Run-length encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string `"aabccc "` we replace `"aa "` by `"a2 "` and replace `"ccc "` by `"c3 "`. Thus the compressed string becomes `"a2bc3 "`.

Notice that in this problem, we are not adding `'1'` after single characters.

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You need to delete **at most** `k` characters from `s` such that the run-length encoded version of `s` has minimum length.

Find the _minimum length of the run-length encoded version of_ `s` _after deleting at most_ `k` _characters_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "aaabcccd ", k = 2
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Compressing s without deleting anything will give us  "a3bc3d " of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s =  "abcccd " which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be  "a3c3 " of length 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "aabbaa ", k = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be  "a4 " of length 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "aaaaaaaaaaa ", k = 0
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything. The compressed string is  "a11 " of length 3.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= k <= s.length`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

Question ID: 1537
Code Description: You are given two **sorted** arrays of distinct integers `nums1` and `nums2.`

A **valid path** is defined as follows:

*   Choose array `nums1` or `nums2` to traverse (from index-0).
*   Traverse the current array from left to right.
*   If you are reading any value that is present in `nums1` and `nums2` you are allowed to change your path to the other array. (Only one repeated value is considered in the valid path).

The **score** is defined as the sum of uniques values in a valid path.

Return _the maximum score you can obtain of all possible **valid paths**_. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[2,4,5,8,10\], nums2 = \[4,6,8,9\]
**Output:** 30
**Explanation:** Valid paths:
\[2,4,5,8,10\], \[2,4,5,8,9\], \[2,4,6,8,9\], \[2,4,6,8,10\],  (starting from nums1)
\[4,6,8,9\], \[4,5,8,10\], \[4,5,8,9\], \[4,6,8,10\]    (starting from nums2)
The maximum is obtained with the path in green **\[2,4,6,8,10\]**.

Code Description: Given a wooden stick of length `n` units. The stick is labelled from `0` to `n`. For example, a stick of length **6** is labelled as follows:

Given an integer array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` denotes a position you should perform a cut at.

You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.

The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.

Return _the minimum total cost_ of the cuts.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 7, cuts = \[1,3,4,5\]
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:** Using cuts order = \[1, 3, 4, 5\] as in the input leads to the following scenario:
 
The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.
Rearranging the cuts to be \[3, 5, 1, 4\] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 9, cuts = \[5,6,1,4,2\]
**Output:** 22
**Explanation:** If you try the given cuts ordering the cost will be 25.
There are much ordering with total cost <= 25, for example, the order \[4, 6, 5, 2, 1\] has total cost = 22 which is the minimum possible.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 106`
*   `1 <= cuts.length <= min(n - 1, 100)`
*   `1 <= cuts[i] <= n - 1`
*   All the integers in `cuts` array are **distinct**.

*   Eat one orange.
*   If the number of remaining oranges `n` is divisible by `2` then you can eat `n / 2` oranges.
*   If the number of remaining oranges `n` is divisible by `3` then you can eat `2 * (n / 3)` oranges.

You can only choose one of the actions per day.

Given the integer `n`, return _the minimum number of days to eat_ `n` _oranges_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 10
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** You have 10 oranges.
Day 1: Eat 1 orange,  10 - 1 = 9.

Question ID: 1563
Code Description: There are several stones **arranged in a row**, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array `stoneValue`.

In each round of the game, Alice divides the row into **two non-empty rows** (i.e. left row and right row), then Bob calculates the value of each row which is the sum of the values of all the stones in this row. Bob throws away the row which has the maximum value, and Alice's score increases by the value of the remaining row. If the value of the two rows are equal, Bob lets Alice decide which row will be thrown away. The next round starts with the remaining row.

The game ends when there is only **one stone remaining**. Alice's is initially **zero**.

Return _the maximum score that Alice can obtain_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stoneValue = \[6,2,3,4,5,5\]
**Output:** 18
**Explanation:** In the first round, Alice divides the row to \[6,2,3\], \[4,5,5\]. The left row has the value 11 and the right row has value 14. Bob throws away the right row and Alice's score is now 11.
In the second round Alice divides the row to \[6\], \[2,3\]. This time Bob throws away the left row and Alice's score becomes 16 (11 + 5).
The last round Alice has only one choice to divide the row which is \[2\], \[3\]. Bob throws away the right row and Alice's score is now 18 (16 + 2). The game ends because only one stone is remaining in the row.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** stoneValue = \[7,7,7,7,7,7,7\]
**Output:** 28

**Example 3:**

**Input:** stoneValue = \[4\]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= stoneValue.length <= 500`

    # Problem Description3
    Given a string `s`, return the number of **unique** _palindromes_ that can be constructed from it.

    A string is a **palindrome** if it can be read the same forward and backward, for example, `abccba`, `aacbbc`, `abcba` are palindromes.

    A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

    A **unique** _palindrome_ is a palindrome that is not a substring of another palindrome.

    **Example 1:**

    **Input:** s =  "abc"
    **Output:**  2
    **Explanation:**  The palindromes are: "aacbab" and "ababc".

    **Example 2:**

Code Description: Given an array of integers `nums`, find the maximum length of a subarray where the product of all its elements is positive.

A subarray of an array is a consecutive sequence of zero or more values taken out of that array.

Return _the maximum length of a subarray with positive product_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,-2,-3,4\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The array nums already has a positive product of 24.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,-2,-3,-4\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The longest subarray with positive product is \[1,-2,-3\] which has a product of 6.
Notice that we cannot include 0 in the subarray since that'll make the product 0 which is not positive.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1,-2,-3,0,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The longest subarray with positive product is \[-1,-2\] or \[-2,-3\].

Question ID: 1569
Code Description: Given an array `nums` that represents a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. We are going to construct a binary search tree (BST) by inserting the elements of `nums` in order into an initially empty BST. Find the number of different ways to reorder `nums` so that the constructed BST is identical to that formed from the original array `nums`.

*   For example, given `nums = [2,1,3]`, we will have 2 as the root, 1 as a left child, and 3 as a right child. The array `[2,3,1]` also yields the same BST but `[3,2,1]` yields a different BST.

Return _the number of ways to reorder_ `nums` _such that the BST formed is identical to the original BST formed from_ `nums`.

Since the answer may be very large, **return it modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,1,3\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We can reorder nums to be \[2,3,1\] which will yield the same BST. There are no other ways to reorder nums which will yield the same BST.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,4,5,1,2\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The following 5 arrays will yield the same BST: 
\[3,1,2,4,5\]
\[3,1,4,2,5\]
\[3,1,4,5,2\]
\[3,4,1,2,5\]
\[3,4,1,5,2\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are no other orderings of nums that will yield the same BST.

Question ID: 1575
Code Description: You are given an array of **distinct** positive integers locations where `locations[i]` represents the position of city `i`. You are also given integers `start`, `finish` and `fuel` representing the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.

At each step, if you are at city `i`, you can pick any city `j` such that `j != i` and `0 <= j < locations.length` and move to city `j`. Moving from city `i` to city `j` reduces the amount of fuel you have by `|locations[i] - locations[j]|`. Please notice that `|x|` denotes the absolute value of `x`.

Notice that `fuel` **cannot** become negative at any point in time, and that you are **allowed** to visit any city more than once (including `start` and `finish`).

Return _the count of all possible routes from_ `start` _to_ `finish`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** locations = \[2,3,6,8,4\], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The following are all possible routes, each uses 5 units of fuel:
1 -> 3
1 -> 2 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** locations = \[4,3,1\], start = 1, finish = 0, fuel = 6

**Explanation:** The following are all possible routes:
1 -> 0, used fuel = 1
1 -> 2 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 3
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5

**Example 3:**

**Input:** locations = \[5,2,1\], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 3
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** It is impossible to get from 0 to 2 using only 3 units of fuel since the shortest route needs 4 units of fuel.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= locations.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= locations[i] <= 109`
*   All integers in `locations` are **distinct**.

Code Description: There are `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are given an array `edges` of size `n-1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` represents a bidirectional edge between cities `ui` and `vi`. There exists a unique path between each pair of cities. In other words, the cities form a **tree**.

A **subtree** is a subset of cities where every city is reachable from every other city in the subset, where the path between each pair passes through only the cities from the subset. Two subtrees are different if there is a city in one subtree that is not present in the other.

For each `d` from `1` to `n-1`, find the number of subtrees in which the **maximum distance** between any two cities in the subtree is equal to `d`.

Return _an array of size_ `n-1` _where the_ `dth` _element **(1-indexed)** is the number of subtrees in which the **maximum distance** between any two cities is equal to_ `d`.

**Notice** that the **distance** between the two cities is the number of edges in the path between them.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = \[\[1,2\],\[2,3\],\[2,4\]\]
**Output:** \[3,4,0\]
**Explanation:**
The subtrees with subsets {1,2}, {2,3} and {2,4} have a max distance of 1.
The subtrees with subsets {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {2,3,4} and {1,2,3,4} have a max distance of 2.
No subtree has two nodes where the max distance between them is 3.

Question ID: 1626
Code Description: You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest overall score. The score of the team is the **sum** of scores of all the players in the team.

However, the basketball team is not allowed to have **conflicts**. A **conflict** exists if a younger player has a **strictly higher** score than an older player. A conflict does **not** occur between players of the same age.

Given two lists, `scores` and `ages`, where each `scores[i]` and `ages[i]` represents the score and age of the `ith` player, respectively, return _the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** scores = \[1,3,5,10,15\], ages = \[1,2,3,4,5\]
**Output:** 34
**Explanation:** You can choose all the players.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** scores = \[4,5,6,5\], ages = \[2,1,2,1\]
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:** It is best to choose the last 3 players. Notice that you are allowed to choose multiple people of the same age.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** scores = \[1,2,3,5\], ages = \[8,9,10,1\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** It is best to choose the first 3 players.

Question ID: 1638
Code Description: Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the number of ways you can choose a non-empty substring of `s` and replace a **single character** by a different character such that the resulting substring is a substring of `t`. In other words, find the number of substrings in `s` that differ from some substring in `t` by **exactly** one character.

For example, the underlined substrings in `"computer "` and `"computation "` only differ by the `'e'`/`'a'`, so this is a valid way.

Return _the number of substrings that satisfy the condition above._

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "aba ", t =  "baba "
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by exactly 1 character:
( "aba ",  "baba ")
( "aba ",  "baba ")
( "aba ",  "baba ")
( "aba ",  "baba ")
( "aba ",  "baba ")
( "aba ",  "baba ")
The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.

​​**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "ab ", t =  "bb "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by 1 character:
( "ab ",  "bb ")
( "ab ",  "bb ")
( "ab ",  "bb ")
​​​​The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.

Question ID: 1643
Code Description: Bob is standing at cell `(0, 0)`, and he wants to reach `destination`: `(row, column)`. He can only travel **right** and **down**. You are going to help Bob by providing **instructions** for him to reach `destination`.

The **instructions** are represented as a string, where each character is either:

*   `'H'`, meaning move horizontally (go **right**), or
*   `'V'`, meaning move vertically (go **down**).

Multiple **instructions** will lead Bob to `destination`. For example, if `destination` is `(2, 3)`, both `"HHHVV "` and `"HVHVH "` are valid **instructions**.

However, Bob is very picky. Bob has a lucky number `k`, and he wants the `kth` **lexicographically smallest instructions** that will lead him to `destination`. `k` is **1-indexed**.

Given an integer array `destination` and an integer `k`, return _the_ `kth` _**lexicographically smallest instructions** that will take Bob to_ `destination`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** destination = \[2,3\], k = 1
**Output:**  "HHHVV "
**Explanation:** All the instructions that reach (2, 3) in lexicographic order are as follows:
\[ "HHHVV ",  "HHVHV ",  "HHVVH ",  "HVHHV ",  "HVHVH ",  "HVVHH ",  "VHHHV ",  "VHHVH ",  "VHVHH ",  "VVHHH "\].

**Input:** destination = \[2,3\], k = 2
**Output:**  "HHVHV "

**Example 3:**

**Input:** destination = \[2,3\], k = 3
**Output:**  "HHVVH "

**Constraints:**

*   `destination.length == 2`

Question ID: 1659
Code Description: You are given four integers, `m`, `n`, `introvertsCount`, and `extrovertsCount`. You have an `m x n` grid, and there are two types of people: introverts and extroverts. There are `introvertsCount` introverts and `extrovertsCount` extroverts.

You should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of them one grid cell. Note that you **do not** have to have all the people living in the grid.

The **happiness** of each person is calculated as follows:

*   Introverts **start** with `120` happiness and **lose** `30` happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).
*   Extroverts **start** with `40` happiness and **gain** `20` happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Neighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.

The **grid happiness** is the **sum** of each person's happiness. Return _the **maximum possible grid happiness**._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 2, n = 3, introvertsCount = 1, extrovertsCount = 2
**Output:** 240
**Explanation:** Assume the grid is 1-indexed with coordinates (row, column).
We can put the introvert in cell (1,1) and put the extroverts in cells (1,3) and (2,3).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 \* 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Extrovert at (1,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 \* 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
- Extrovert at (2,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 \* 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
The grid happiness is 120 + 60 + 60 = 240.
The above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1
**Output:** 260
**Explanation:** Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 \* 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 \* 20) (2 neighbors) = 80
- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 \* 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
The grid happiness is 90 + 80 + 90 = 260.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** m = 2, n = 2, introvertsCount = 4, extrovertsCount = 0
**Output:** 240

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m, n <= 5`
*   `0 <= introvertsCount, extrovertsCount <= min(m * n, 6)`
Generated Code:
** m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1
**Output:** 260
**Explanation:** We can put the introverts in cells (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert in cell (2,1).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 \* 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 \* 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 \* 20) (2 neighbors) = 100
The grid happiness is 90 + 90 + 100 = 260.
The above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introverts stay in the light green cells while the extrovert lives on the light purple cell.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** m = 2, n = 2, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 0
**Output:** 240
**Explanation:** We can put the introverts in cells (1,1) and (2,2) and the extroverts in cells (1,2) and (2,1).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 \* 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Introvert at (2,2) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 \* 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Introvert at (1,2) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 \* 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Introvert at (2,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 \* 30) (1 neighbor) = 90

    Given a string `s`, return the number of **palindromic substrings** in it.

A string is a **palindrome** if it reads the same backward as forward.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "abc"
**Output:**  3
**Explanation:**  Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "aaa"
**Output:**  6
**Explanation:**  Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

Question ID: 1690
Code Description: Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with **Alice starting first**.

There are `n` stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, they can **remove** either the leftmost stone or the rightmost stone from the row and receive points equal to the **sum** of the remaining stones' values in the row. The winner is the one with the higher score when there are no stones left to remove.

Bob found that he will always lose this game (poor Bob, he always loses), so he decided to **minimize the score's difference**. Alice's goal is to **maximize the difference** in the score.

Given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` represents the value of the `ith` stone **from the left**, return _the **difference** in Alice and Bob's score if they both play **optimally**._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stones = \[5,3,1,4,2\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** 
- Alice removes 2 and gets 5 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 13 points. Alice = 13, Bob = 0, stones = \[5,3,1,4\].
- Bob removes 5 and gets 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 points. Alice = 13, Bob = 8, stones = \[3,1,4\].
- Alice removes 3 and gets 1 + 4 = 5 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 8, stones = \[1,4\].
- Bob removes 1 and gets 4 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 12, stones = \[4\].
- Alice removes 4 and gets 0 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 12, stones = \[\].
The score difference is 18 - 12 = 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** stones = \[7,90,5,1,100,10,10,2\]
**Output:** 122

**Constraints:**

*   `n == stones.length`
*   `2 <= n <= 1000`
*   `1 <= stones[i] <= 1000`

Code Description: You are given an integer array `jobs`, where `jobs[i]` is the amount of time it takes to complete the `ith` job.

There are `k` workers that you can assign jobs to. Each job should be assigned to **exactly** one worker. The **working time** of a worker is the sum of the time it takes to complete all jobs assigned to them. Your goal is to devise an optimal assignment such that the **maximum working time** of any worker is **minimized**.

_Return the **minimum** possible **maximum working time** of any assignment._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** jobs = \[3,2,3\], k = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** By assigning each person one job, the maximum time is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** jobs = \[1,2,4,7,8\], k = 2

Question ID: 1728
Code Description: A game is played by a cat and a mouse named Cat and Mouse.

The environment is represented by a `grid` of size `rows x cols`, where each element is a wall, floor, player (Cat, Mouse), or food.

*   Players are represented by the characters `'C'`(Cat)`,'M'`(Mouse).
*   Floors are represented by the character `'.'` and can be walked on.
*   Walls are represented by the character `'#'` and cannot be walked on.
*   Food is represented by the character `'F'` and can be walked on.
*   There is only one of each character `'C'`, `'M'`, and `'F'` in `grid`.

Mouse and Cat play according to the following rules:

*   Mouse **moves first**, then they take turns to move.
*   During each turn, Cat and Mouse can jump in one of the four directions (left, right, up, down). They cannot jump over the wall nor outside of the `grid`.
*   `catJump, mouseJump` are the maximum lengths Cat and Mouse can jump at a time, respectively. Cat and Mouse can jump less than the maximum length.
*   Staying in the same position is allowed.
*   Mouse can jump over Cat.

The game can end in 4 ways:

*   If Cat occupies the same position as Mouse, Cat wins.
*   If Cat reaches the food first, Cat wins.
*   If Mouse reaches the food first, Mouse wins.
*   If Mouse cannot get to the food within 1000 turns, Cat wins.

Given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` and two integers `catJump` and `mouseJump`, return `true` _if Mouse can win the game if both Cat and Mouse play optimally, otherwise return_ `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[ "####F ", "#C... ", "M.... "\], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 2
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Cat cannot catch Mouse on its turn nor can it get the food before Mouse.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[ "M.C...F "\], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 4
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = \[ "M.C...F "\], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 3
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `rows == grid.length`
*   `cols = grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= rows, cols <= 8`

The `ith` event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the **entire** event. Note that the end day is **inclusive**: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.

Return _the **maximum sum** of values that you can receive by attending events._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** events = \[\[1,2,4\],\[3,4,3\],\[2,3,1\]\], k = 2

Code Description: You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `goal`.

You want to choose a subsequence of `nums` such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to `goal`. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is `sum`, then you want to **minimize the absolute difference** `abs(sum - goal)`.

Return _the **minimum** possible value of_ `abs(sum - goal)`.

Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements **(possibly all or none)** of the original array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[5,-7,3,5\], goal = 6
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[7,-9,15,-2\], goal = -5
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Choose the subsequence \[7,-9,-2\], with a sum of -4.

Code Description: You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums` and `multipliers` of size `n` and `m` respectively, where `n >= m`.

You begin with a score of `0`. You want to perform **exactly** `m` operations. On the `ith` operation (**0-indexed**) you will:

*   Choose one integer `x` from **either the start or the end** of the array `nums`.
*   Add `multipliers[i] * x` to your score.
    *   Note that `multipliers[0]` corresponds to the first operation, `multipliers[1]` to the second operation, and so on.
*   Remove `x` from `nums`.

Return _the **maximum** score after performing_ `m` _operations._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\], multipliers = \[3,2,1\]
**Output:** 14
**Explanation:** An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the end, \[1,2,**3**\], adding 3 \* 3 = 9 to the score.
- Choose from the end, \[1,**2**\], adding 2 \* 2 = 4 to the score.
- Choose from the end, \[**1**\], adding 1 \* 1 = 1 to the score.
The total score is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1\], multipliers = \[-10,-5,3,4,6\]
**Output:** 102
**Explanation:** An optimal solution is as follows:

Code Description: You are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string in the following manner:

*   Choose some **non-empty** subsequence `subsequence1` from `word1`.
*   Choose some **non-empty** subsequence `subsequence2` from `word2`.
*   Concatenate the subsequences: `subsequence1 + subsequence2`, to make the string.

Return _the **length** of the longest **palindrome** that can be constructed in the described manner._ If no palindromes can be constructed, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string `s` is a string that can be made by deleting some (possibly none) characters from `s` without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward as well as backward.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word1 =  "cacb ", word2 =  "cbba "
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Choose  "ab " from word1 and  "cba " from word2 to make  "abcba ", which is a palindrome.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word1 =  "ab ", word2 =  "ab "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Choose  "ab " from word1 and  "a " from word2 to make  "aba ", which is a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** word1 =  "aa ", word2 =  "bb "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** You cannot construct a palindrome from the described method, so return 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 1000`
*   `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

Question ID: 1786
Code Description: There is an undirected weighted connected graph. You are given a positive integer `n` which denotes that the graph has `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, and an array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi, weighti]` denotes that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` with weight equal to `weighti`.

A path from node `start` to node `end` is a sequence of nodes `[z0, z1, z2, ..., zk]` such that `z0 = start` and `zk = end` and there is an edge between `zi` and `zi+1` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.

The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path. Let `distanceToLastNode(x)` denote the shortest distance of a path between node `n` and node `x`. A **restricted path** is a path that also satisfies that `distanceToLastNode(zi) > distanceToLastNode(zi+1)` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.

Return _the number of restricted paths from node_ `1` _to node_ `n`. Since that number may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = \[\[1,2,3\],\[1,3,3\],\[2,3,1\],\[1,4,2\],\[5,2,2\],\[3,5,1\],\[5,4,10\]\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Each circle contains the node number in black and its `distanceToLastNode value in blue.` The three restricted paths are:
1) 1 --> 2 --> 5
2) 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 5
3) 1 --> 3 --> 5

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 7, edges = \[\[1,3,1\],\[4,1,2\],\[7,3,4\],\[2,5,3\],\[5,6,1\],\[6,7,2\],\[7,5,3\],\[2,6,4\]\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Each circle contains the node number in black and its `distanceToLastNode value in blue.` The only restricted path is 1 --> 3 --> 7.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
*   `n - 1 <= edges.length <= 4 * 104`
*   `edges[i].length == 3`
*   `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
*   `ui != vi`
*   `1 <= weighti <= 105`
*   There is at most one edge between any two nodes.
*   There is at least one path between any two nodes.

Code Description: There is a **3 lane road** of length `n` that consists of `n + 1` **points** labeled from `0` to `n`. A frog **starts** at point `0` in the **second** lane and wants to jump to point `n`. However, there could be obstacles along the way.

You are given an array `obstacles` of length `n + 1` where each `obstacles[i]` (**ranging from 0 to 3**) describes an obstacle on the lane `obstacles[i]` at point `i`. If `obstacles[i] == 0`, there are no obstacles at point `i`. There will be **at most one** obstacle in the 3 lanes at each point.

*   For example, if `obstacles[2] == 1`, then there is an obstacle on lane 1 at point 2.

The frog can only travel from point `i` to point `i + 1` on the same lane if there is not an obstacle on the lane at point `i + 1`. To avoid obstacles, the frog can also perform a **side jump** to jump to **another** lane (even if they are not adjacent) at the **same** point if there is no obstacle on the new lane.

*   For example, the frog can jump from lane 3 at point 3 to lane 1 at point 3.

Return _the **minimum number of side jumps** the frog needs to reach **any lane** at point n starting from lane `2` at point 0._

**Note:** There will be no obstacles on points `0` and `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** obstacles = \[0,1,2,3,0\]
**Output:** 2 
**Explanation:** The optimal solution is shown by the arrows above. There are 2 side jumps (red arrows).
Note that the frog can jump over obstacles only when making side jumps (as shown at point 2).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** obstacles = \[0,1,1,3,3,0\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are no obstacles on lane 2. No side jumps are required.

Code Description: There are `n` uniquely-sized sticks whose lengths are integers from `1` to `n`. You want to arrange the sticks such that **exactly** `k` sticks are **visible** from the left. A stick is **visible** from the left if there are no **longer** sticks to the **left** of it.

*   For example, if the sticks are arranged `[1,3,2,5,4]`, then the sticks with lengths `1`, `3`, and `5` are visible from the left.

Given `n` and `k`, return _the **number** of such arrangements_. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 2
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** \[1,3,2\], \[2,3,1\], and \[2,1,3\] are the only arrangements such that exactly 2 sticks are visible.
The visible sticks are underlined.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, k = 5
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** \[1,2,3,4,5\] is the only arrangement such that all 5 sticks are visible.
The visible sticks are underlined.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 20, k = 11
**Output:** 647427950
**Explanation:** There are 647427950 (mod 109 \+ 7) ways to rearrange the sticks such that exactly 11 sticks are visible.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
*   `1 <= k <= n`

Question ID: 1872
Code Description: Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with **Alice starting first**.

There are `n` stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the number of stones is **more than one**, they will do the following:

1.  Choose an integer `x > 1`, and **remove** the leftmost `x` stones from the row.
2.  Add the **sum** of the **removed** stones' values to the player's score.
3.  Place a **new stone**, whose value is equal to that sum, on the left side of the row.

The game stops when **only** **one** stone is left in the row.

The **score difference** between Alice and Bob is `(Alice's score - Bob's score)`. Alice's goal is to **maximize** the score difference, and Bob's goal is the **minimize** the score difference.

Given an integer array `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i]` represents the value of the `ith` stone **from the left**, return _the **score difference** between Alice and Bob if they both play **optimally**._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stones = \[-1,2,-3,4,-5\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:**
- Alice removes the first 4 stones, adds (-1) + 2 + (-3) + 4 = 2 to her score, and places a stone of
  value 2 on the left. stones = \[2,-5\].
- Bob removes the first 2 stones, adds 2 + (-5) = -3 to his score, and places a stone of value -3 on
  the left. stones = \[-3\].
The difference between their scores is 2 - (-3) = 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** stones = \[7,-6,5,10,5,-2,-6\]
**Output:** 13
**Explanation:**
- Alice removes all stones, adds 7 + (-6) + 5 + 10 + 5 + (-2) + (-6) = 13 to her score, and places a
  stone of value 13 on the left. stones = \[13\].
The difference between their scores is 13 - 0 = 13.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** stones = \[-10,-12\]
**Output:** -22
**Explanation:**
- Alice can only make one move, which is to remove both stones. She adds (-10) + (-12) = -22 to her
  score and places a stone of value -22 on the left. stones = \[-22\].
The difference between their scores is (-22) - 0 = -22.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == stones.length`
*   `2 <= n <= 105`
*   `-104 <= stones[i] <= 104`
Generated Code:

Question ID: 1879
Code Description: You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of length `n`.

The **XOR sum** of the two integer arrays is `(nums1[0] XOR nums2[0]) + (nums1[1] XOR nums2[1]) + ... + (nums1[n - 1] XOR nums2[n - 1])` (**0-indexed**).

*   For example, the **XOR sum** of `[1,2,3]` and `[3,2,1]` is equal to `(1 XOR 3) + (2 XOR 2) + (3 XOR 1) = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4`.

Rearrange the elements of `nums2` such that the resulting **XOR sum** is **minimized**.

Return _the **XOR sum** after the rearrangement_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,2\], nums2 = \[2,3\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Rearrange `nums2` so that it becomes `[3,2]`.
The XOR sum is (1 XOR 3) + (2 XOR 2) = 2 + 0 = 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,0,3\], nums2 = \[5,3,4\]
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** Rearrange `nums2` so that it becomes `[5,4,3]`. 
The XOR sum is (1 XOR 5) + (0 XOR 4) + (3 XOR 3) = 4 + 4 + 0 = 8.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums1.length`
*   `n == nums2.length`

Question ID: 1884
Code Description: You are given **two identical** eggs and you have access to a building with `n` floors labeled from `1` to `n`.

You know that there exists a floor `f` where `0 <= f <= n` such that any egg dropped at a floor **higher** than `f` will **break**, and any egg dropped **at or below** floor `f` will **not break**.

In each move, you may take an **unbroken** egg and drop it from any floor `x` (where `1 <= x <= n`). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may **reuse** it in future moves.

Return _the **minimum number of moves** that you need to determine **with certainty** what the value of_ `f` is.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We can drop the first egg from floor 1 and the second egg from floor 2.
If the first egg breaks, we know that f = 0.
If the second egg breaks but the first egg didn't, we know that f = 1.
Otherwise, if both eggs survive, we know that f = 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 100
**Output:** 14
**Explanation:** One optimal strategy is:
- Drop the 1st egg at floor 9. If it breaks, we know f is between 0 and 8. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 1 and going up one at a time to find f within 8 more drops. Total drops is 1 + 8 = 9.
- If the 1st egg does not break, drop the 1st egg again at floor 22. If it breaks, we know f is between 9 and 21. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 10 and going up one at a time to find f within 12 more drops. Total drops is 2 + 12 = 14.
- If the 1st egg does not break again, follow a similar process dropping the 1st egg from floors 34, 45, 55, 64, 72, 79, 85, 90, 94, 97, 99, and 100.
Regardless of the outcome, it takes at most 14 drops to determine f.

Code Description: You are given a binary string `s`. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:

*   **Type-1: Remove** the character at the start of the string `s` and **append** it to the end of the string.
*   **Type-2: Pick** any character in `s` and **flip** its value, i.e., if its value is `'0'` it becomes `'1'` and vice-versa.

Return _the **minimum** number of **type-2** operations you need to perform_ _such that_ `s` _becomes **alternating**._

The string is called **alternating** if no two adjacent characters are equal.

*   For example, the strings `"010 "` and `"1010 "` are alternating, while the string `"0100 "` is not.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "111000 "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation**: Use the first operation two times to make s =  "100011 ".
Then, use the second operation on the third and sixth elements to make s =  "101010 ".

**Example 2:**

Code Description: You are given a **valid** boolean expression as a string `expression` consisting of the characters `'1'`,`'0'`,`'&'` (bitwise **AND** operator),`'|'` (bitwise **OR** operator),`'('`, and `')'`.

*   For example, `"()1|1 "` and `"(1)&() "` are **not valid** while `"1 "`, `"(((1))|(0)) "`, and `"1|(0&(1)) "` are **valid** expressions.

Return _the **minimum cost** to change the final value of the expression_.

*   For example, if `expression = "1|1|(0&0)&1 "`, its **value** is `1|1|(0&0)&1 = 1|1|0&1 = 1|0&1 = 1&1 = 1`. We want to apply operations so that the **new** expression evaluates to `0`.

The **cost** of changing the final value of an expression is the **number of operations** performed on the expression. The types of **operations** are described as follows:

*   Turn a `'1'` into a `'0'`.
*   Turn a `'0'` into a `'1'`.
*   Turn a `'&'` into a `'|'`.
*   Turn a `'|'` into a `'&'`.

**Note:** `'&'` does **not** take precedence over `'|'` in the **order of calculation**. Evaluate parentheses **first**, then in **left-to-right** order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** expression =  "1&(0|1) "
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We can turn  "1&(0**|**1) " into  "1&(0**&**1) " by changing the '|' to a '&' using 1 operation.
The new expression evaluates to 0. 

**Example 2:**

Question ID: 1900
Code Description: There is a tournament where `n` players are participating. The players are standing in a single row and are numbered from `1` to `n` based on their **initial** standing position (player `1` is the first player in the row, player `2` is the second player in the row, etc.).

The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number `1`). In each round, the `ith` player from the front of the row competes against the `ith` player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.

*   For example, if the row consists of players `1, 2, 4, 6, 7`
    *   Player `1` competes against player `7`.
    *   Player `2` competes against player `6`.
    *   Player `4` automatically advances to the next round.

After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the **original ordering** assigned to them initially (ascending order).

The players numbered `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may **choose** the outcome of this round.

Given the integers `n`, `firstPlayer`, and `secondPlayer`, return _an integer array containing two values, the **earliest** possible round number and the **latest** possible round number in which these two players will compete against each other, respectively_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 11, firstPlayer = 2, secondPlayer = 4
**Output:** \[3,4\]
**Explanation:**
One possible scenario which leads to the earliest round number:
First round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
Second round: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11
Third round: 2, 3, 4
One possible scenario which leads to the latest round number:
First round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
Second round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Third round: 1, 2, 4
Fourth round: 2, 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, firstPlayer = 1, secondPlayer = 5
**Output:** \[1,1\]
**Explanation:** The players numbered 1 and 5 compete in the first round.
There is no way to make them compete in any other round.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 28`
*   `1 <= firstPlayer < secondPlayer <= n`
Generated Code:

Second round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Third round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 11, firstPlayer = 2, secondPlayer = 10
**Output:** \[2,2\]
**Explanation:**
The first round will be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
The second round will be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
The third round will be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
The fourth round will be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
The fifth round will be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
The sixth round will be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
The seventh round will be: 1, 2, 3, 4
The eighth round will be: 1, 2, 3
The ninth round will be: 1, 2
The tenth round will be: 1
The eleventh round will be: 1

Question ID: 1911
Code Description: The **alternating sum** of a **0-indexed** array is defined as the **sum** of the elements at **even** indices **minus** the **sum** of the elements at **odd** indices.

*   For example, the alternating sum of `[4,2,5,3]` is `(4 + 5) - (2 + 3) = 4`.

Given an array `nums`, return _the **maximum alternating sum** of any subsequence of_ `nums` _(after **reindexing** the elements of the subsequence)_.

A **subsequence** of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, `[2,7,4]` is a subsequence of `[4,2,3,7,2,1,4]` (the underlined elements), while `[2,4,2]` is not.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,2,5,3\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** It is optimal to choose the subsequence \[4,2,5\] with alternating sum (4 + 5) - 2 = 7.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[5,6,7,8\]
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** It is optimal to choose the subsequence \[8\] with alternating sum 8.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[6,2,1,2,4,5\]
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** It is optimal to choose the subsequence \[6,1,5\] with alternating sum (6 + 5) - 1 = 10.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`

Question ID: 1916
Code Description: You are an ant tasked with adding `n` new rooms numbered `0` to `n-1` to your colony. You are given the expansion plan as a **0-indexed** integer array of length `n`, `prevRoom`, where `prevRoom[i]` indicates that you must build room `prevRoom[i]` before building room `i`, and these two rooms must be connected **directly**. Room `0` is already built, so `prevRoom[0] = -1`. The expansion plan is given such that once all the rooms are built, every room will be reachable from room `0`.

You can only build **one room** at a time, and you can travel freely between rooms you have **already built** only if they are **connected**. You can choose to build **any room** as long as its **previous room** is already built.

Return _the **number of different orders** you can build all the rooms in_. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prevRoom = \[-1,0,1\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There is only one way to build the additional rooms: 0 -> 1 -> 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prevRoom = \[-1,0,0,1,2\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:**
The 6 ways are:
0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4
0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3
0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4
0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3

**Constraints:**

*   `n == prevRoom.length`
*   `2 <= n <= 105`
*   `prevRoom[0] == -1`
*   `0 <= prevRoom[i] < n` for all `1 <= i < n`
*   Every room is reachable from room `0` once all the rooms are built.

    # Problem Description3
    Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of **even** length consisting of an **equal** number of positive and negative integers.

You should rearrange the elements of `nums` such that every **even** index should contain a **positive** integer, and every **odd** index should contain a **negative** integer.

Return _the rearranged array_.

**Example 1:**

Question ID: 1928
Code Description: There is a country of `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` where **all the cities are connected** by bi-directional roads. The roads are represented as a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [xi, yi, timei]` denotes a road between cities `xi` and `yi` that takes `timei` minutes to travel. There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.

Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a **0-indexed** integer array `passingFees` of length `n` where `passingFees[j]` is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city `j`.

In the beginning, you are at city `0` and want to reach city `n - 1` in `maxTime` **minutes or less**. The **cost** of your journey is the **summation of passing fees** for each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey (**including** the source and destination cities).

Given `maxTime`, `edges`, and `passingFees`, return _the **minimum cost** to complete your journey, or_ `-1` _if you cannot complete it within_ `maxTime` _minutes_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** maxTime = 30, edges = \[\[0,1,10\],\[1,2,10\],\[2,5,10\],\[0,3,1\],\[3,4,10\],\[4,5,15\]\], passingFees = \[5,1,2,20,20,3\]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The path to take is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5, which takes 30 minutes and has $11 worth of passing fees.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** maxTime = 29, edges = \[\[0,1,10\],\[1,2,10\],\[2,5,10\],\[0,3,1\],\[3,4,10\],\[4,5,15\]\], passingFees = \[5,1,2,20,20,3\]
**Output:** 48
**Explanation:** The path to take is 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, which takes 26 minutes and has $48 worth of passing fees.
You cannot take path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 since it would take too long.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** maxTime = 25, edges = \[\[0,1,10\],\[1,2,10\],\[2,5,10\],\[0,3,1\],\[3,4,10\],\[4,5,15\]\], passingFees = \[5,1,2,20,20,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is no way to reach city 5 from city 0 within 25 minutes.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= maxTime <= 1000`
*   `n == passingFees.length`
*   `2 <= n <= 1000`

Question ID: 1947
Code Description: There is a survey that consists of `n` questions where each question's answer is either `0` (no) or `1` (yes).

The survey was given to `m` students numbered from `0` to `m - 1` and `m` mentors numbered from `0` to `m - 1`. The answers of the students are represented by a 2D integer array `students` where `students[i]` is an integer array that contains the answers of the `ith` student (**0-indexed**). The answers of the mentors are represented by a 2D integer array `mentors` where `mentors[j]` is an integer array that contains the answers of the `jth` mentor (**0-indexed**).

Each student will be assigned to **one** mentor, and each mentor will have **one** student assigned to them. The **compatibility score** of a student-mentor pair is the number of answers that are the same for both the student and the mentor.

*   For example, if the student's answers were `[1, 0, 1]` and the mentor's answers were `[0, 0, 1]`, then their compatibility score is 2 because only the second and the third answers are the same.

You are tasked with finding the optimal student-mentor pairings to **maximize** the **sum of the compatibility scores**.

Given `students` and `mentors`, return _the **maximum compatibility score sum** that can be achieved._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** students = \[\[1,1,0\],\[1,0,1\],\[0,0,1\]\], mentors = \[\[1,0,0\],\[0,0,1\],\[1,1,0\]\]
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** We assign students to mentors in the following way:
- student 0 to mentor 2 with a compatibility score of 3.
- student 1 to mentor 0 with a compatibility score of 2.
- student 2 to mentor 1 with a compatibility score of 3.
The compatibility score sum is 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** students = \[\[0,0\],\[0,0\],\[0,0\]\], mentors = \[\[1,1\],\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The compatibility score of any student-mentor pair is 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `m == students.length == mentors.length`
*   `n == students[i].length == mentors[j].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 8`
*   `students[i][k]` is either `0` or `1`.
*   `mentors[j][k]` is either `0` or `1`.
Generated Code:
],\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** Students can't be assigned to mentors because all the students and mentors have the same answers.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** students = \[\[1,1,0,0\],\[1,0,0,1\],\[0,1,1,1\],\[0,0,0,0]\], mentors = \[\[0,0,0,0\],\[1,1,1,1\],\[1,0,1,0\],\[0,0,0,1\]\]
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** We assign students to mentors in the following way:
- student 0 to mentor 3 with a compatibility score of 4.
- student 1 to mentor 0 with a compatibility score of 2.
- student 2 to mentor 1 with a compatibility score of 3.
- student 3 to mentor 2 with a compatibility score of 0.
The compatibility score sum is 4 + 2 + 3 + 0 = 8.

Question ID: 1955
Code Description: A sequence is **special** if it consists of a **positive** number of `0`s, followed by a **positive** number of `1`s, then a **positive** number of `2`s.

*   For example, `[0,1,2]` and `[0,0,1,1,1,2]` are special.
*   In contrast, `[2,1,0]`, `[1]`, and `[0,1,2,0]` are not special.

Given an array `nums` (consisting of **only** integers `0`, `1`, and `2`), return _the **number of different subsequences** that are special_. Since the answer may be very large, **return it modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Two subsequences are **different** if the **set of indices** chosen are different.

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,2,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The special subsequences are bolded \[**0**,**1**,**2**,2\], \[**0**,**1**,2,**2**\], and \[**0**,**1**,**2**,**2**\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,2,0,0\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are no special subsequences in \[2,2,0,0\].

**Example 3:**

Question ID: 1976
Code Description: You are in a city that consists of `n` intersections numbered from `0` to `n - 1` with **bi-directional** roads between some intersections. The inputs are generated such that you can reach any intersection from any other intersection and that there is at most one road between any two intersections.

You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ui, vi, timei]` means that there is a road between intersections `ui` and `vi` that takes `timei` minutes to travel. You want to know in how many ways you can travel from intersection `0` to intersection `n - 1` in the **shortest amount of time**.

Return _the **number of ways** you can arrive at your destination in the **shortest amount of time**_. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 7, roads = \[\[0,6,7\],\[0,1,2\],\[1,2,3\],\[1,3,3\],\[6,3,3\],\[3,5,1\],\[6,5,1\],\[2,5,1\],\[0,4,5\],\[4,6,2\]\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The shortest amount of time it takes to go from intersection 0 to intersection 6 is 7 minutes.
The four ways to get there in 7 minutes are:
- 0 ➝ 6
- 0 ➝ 4 ➝ 6
- 0 ➝ 1 ➝ 2 ➝ 5 ➝ 6
- 0 ➝ 1 ➝ 3 ➝ 5 ➝ 6

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2, roads = \[\[1,0,10\]\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There is only one way to go from intersection 0 to intersection 1, and it takes 10 minutes.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 200`
*   `n - 1 <= roads.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
*   `roads[i].length == 3`
*   `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
*   `1 <= timei <= 109`
*   `ui != vi`
*   There is at most one road connecting any two intersections.
*   You can reach any intersection from any other intersection.
Generated Code:
) / 2`
*   `roads[i].length == 3`
*   `0 <= ui, vi < n`
*   `ui != vi`
*   `1 <= timei <= 100`
*   There is at most one road between any two intersections.
*   The input of the problem is **guaranteed** to be valid.

Question ID: 1986
Code Description: There are `n` tasks assigned to you. The task times are represented as an integer array `tasks` of length `n`, where the `ith` task takes `tasks[i]` hours to finish. A **work session** is when you work for **at most** `sessionTime` consecutive hours and then take a break.

You should finish the given tasks in a way that satisfies the following conditions:

*   If you start a task in a work session, you must complete it in the **same** work session.
*   You can start a new task **immediately** after finishing the previous one.
*   You may complete the tasks in **any order**.

Given `tasks` and `sessionTime`, return _the **minimum** number of **work sessions** needed to finish all the tasks following the conditions above._

The tests are generated such that `sessionTime` is **greater** than or **equal** to the **maximum** element in `tasks[i]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** tasks = \[1,2,3\], sessionTime = 3
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** You can finish the tasks in two work sessions.
- First work session: finish the first and the second tasks in 1 + 2 = 3 hours.
- Second work session: finish the third task in 3 hours.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** tasks = \[3,1,3,1,1\], sessionTime = 8
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** You can finish the tasks in two work sessions.
- First work session: finish all the tasks except the last one in 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 8 hours.
- Second work session: finish the last task in 1 hour.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** tasks = \[1,2,3,4,5\], sessionTime = 15
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** You can finish all the tasks in one work session.

Code Description: You are given a binary string `binary`. A **subsequence** of `binary` is considered **good** if it is **not empty** and has **no leading zeros** (with the exception of `"0 "`).

Find the number of **unique good subsequences** of `binary`.

*   For example, if `binary = "001 "`, then all the **good** subsequences are `[ "0 ", "0 ", "1 "]`, so the **unique** good subsequences are `"0 "` and `"1 "`. Note that subsequences `"00 "`, `"01 "`, and `"001 "` are not good because they have leading zeros.

Return _the number of **unique good subsequences** of_ `binary`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** binary =  "001 "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The good subsequences of binary are \[ "0 ",  "0 ",  "1 "\].
The unique good subsequences are  "0 " and  "1 ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** binary =  "11 "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The good subsequences of binary are \[ "1 ",  "1 ",  "11 "\].
The unique good subsequences are  "1 " and  "11 ".

    *   `[2, 3]`, `[1, 2, 3]`, and `[1, 3]` are **good** subsets with products `6 = 2*3`, `6 = 2*3`, and `3 = 3` respectively.
    *   `[1, 4]` and `[4]` are not **good** subsets with products `4 = 2*2` and `4 = 2*2` respectively.

Return _the number of different **good** subsets in_ `nums` _**modulo**_ `109 + 7`.

A **subset** of `nums` is any array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) elements from `nums`. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4\]

- \[2\]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- \[2,3\]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- \[2,15\]: product is 30, which is the product of distinct primes 2, 3, and 5.
- \[3\]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
- \[15\]: product is 15, which is the product of distinct primes 3 and 5.

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 30`
Generated Code:
